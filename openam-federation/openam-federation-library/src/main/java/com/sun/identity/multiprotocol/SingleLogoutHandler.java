     * IDP proxying configuration, the implementation need to do single
     * logout for the entity acting as both SP and IDP.
     *
     * Normally, there are three types of single logout to be supported:
     * - logout single session (specified by userSession parameter)
     * - logout a list of session (specified by userSession parameter)
     * - logout all sessions for a specific user (specified by userID oarameter)

     * As a single instance of the implementation class will be used internally
     * in the SingleLogoutManager class, implementation of the method shall 
     * not maintain any states.

     *     logout.

     * @param request HTTP servlet request object of the request.
     * @param response HTTP servlet response object of the request.
     * @param isSOAPInitiated True means original single logout request is 
     *     initiated using SOAP binding, false means the original single logout 
     *     request is initiated using HTTP binding.
     * @param isIDPInitiated True means this is identity provider initiated
     *     single logout, false means this is service provider initiated single
     *     logout.

     *          <code>SingleLogoutManager.IDFF</code>

     *          <code>SingleLogoutManager.WS_FED</code>

     *      in the original Single Logout request.
     * @param SPEntityID <code>EntityID</code> of the remote service provider
     *      in the original Single Logout request.
