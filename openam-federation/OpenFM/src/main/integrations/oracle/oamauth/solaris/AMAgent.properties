# The format for this property is:

# Say you want your server to be addressed as xyz.hostname.com whereas the

# xyz.hostname.com and you have specified polices using xyz.hostname.com in
# the OpenAM console, in this file set the mapping as:
#
# com.sun.am.policy.agents.fqdn.map = valid|xyz.hostname.com

# Another example is if you have multiple virtual servers say rst.hostname.com,
# uvw.hostname.com and xyz.hostname.com pointing to the same actual server
# abc.hostname.com and each of the virtual servers have their own policies 
# defined, then the fqdnMap should be defined as follows:
