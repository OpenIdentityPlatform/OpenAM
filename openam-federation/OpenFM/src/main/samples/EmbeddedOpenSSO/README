Steps to run Embedded OpenSSO:

Standalone
==========

1. Extract the opensso-embedded.war file:
   % mkdir <staging area>
   % cd <staging area>
   % jar xvf <war-file-location>/opensso-embedded.war

2. Fix permissions on the run.sh script
   % chmod 755 run.sh

3. Execute the run.sh script:
   % run.sh

4. Modify source/Hello.java and then rebuild to test your modifications.
   % build.sh
   % run.sh

Deployed
==========

1. Extract the opensso-embedded.war file:
   % mkdir <staging area>
   % cd <staging area>
   % jar xvf <war-file-location>/opensso-embedded.war

2. Modify the configuration parameters for your environment:
   % vi WEB-INF/classes/configparam.properties

     SERVER_URL=http://<your host>:<deployed port>
     locale=en_US
     PLATFORM_LOCALE=en_US
     AM_ENC_KEY=abcdefghijklm
     ADMIN_PWD=11111111
     ADMIN_CONFIRM_PWD=11111111
     AMLDAPUSERPASSWD=00000000
     AMLDAPUSERPASSWD_CONFIRM=00000000
     COOKIE_DOMAIN=
     DATA_STORE=embedded
     DIRECTORY_SSL=SIMPLE
     DIRECTORY_SERVER=localhost
     DIRECTORY_PORT=50389
     ROOT_SUFFIX=dc=openam,dc=openidentityplatform,dc=org
     DS_DIRMGRDN=cn=Directory Manager
     DS_DIRMGRPASSWD=11111111

3. Jar the modified contents:
   % jar cvf hello.war *

4. Deploy the war file on your favorite container

5. Goto the Embedded OpenSSO URL in your browser:
   http://myhost:8080/hello/login.jsp
