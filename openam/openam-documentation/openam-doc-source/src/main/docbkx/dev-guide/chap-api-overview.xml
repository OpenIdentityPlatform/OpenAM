 <title>OpenAM APIs and Protocols</title>

 <para>Although policy agents and standards support make it possible for
 applications to use OpenAM for access management without changing your
 code, some deployments require tighter integration, or direct use of
 supported protocols and OpenAM APIs.</para>

 <para>OpenAM supports a range of protocols and APIs that allow you not
 only to define specifically how access is managed in your client
 applications, but also to extend OpenAM capabilities to meet even
 those deployment requirements not yet covered in OpenAM.</para>

 <para>This short chapter presents an overview of the APIs and protocols that
 OpenAM supports.</para>

   <para>OpenAM APIs and SPIs are shown in this diagram in orange, and
   briefly described in the following sections.</para>

 <para>This guide primarily covers the OpenAM client APIs and SPIs, with
 emphasis on the Java APIs.</para>

 <section xml:id="openam-apis">
  <title>OpenAM APIs</title>

  <para>OpenAM provides client application programming interfaces for a variety
  of needs.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>The OpenAM Java APIs provided through the OpenAM Java SDK let your
    Java and Java EE applications call on OpenAM for authentication, and
    authorization in both OpenAM and federated environments.</para>
    <para>Detailed reference information is provided in the <link

    ><citetitle>OpenAM Java SDK API Specification</citetitle></link>.</para>

   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>The C SDK also provides APIs for native applications, such as new
    web server policy agents. The C SDK is delivered with OpenAM for Linux,
    Solaris, and Windows platforms.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenAM exposes a RESTful API that can return JSON or XML over HTTP,
    allowing you to access authentication, authorization, and identity
    services from your web applications using REST clients in the language of
    your choice.</para>

  <title>OpenAM SPIs</title>

  <para>OpenAM provides Java based service provider interfaces to let you
  extend services for the requirements of your particular deployment.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>Some examples of the plugins you can write follow in the list below.
   This guide demonstrates how to implement such plugins.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>Custom OAuth 2.0 scopes plugins define how OpenAM playing the role
    of authorization server handles scopes, including what token information to
    return regarding scopes set when authorization was granted.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Custom authentication plugins let OpenAM authenticate users against
    a new authentication service or an authentication service specific to your
    deployment</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Post authentication plugins perform additional processing at the end
    of the authentication process, but before the subject is authenticated.
    Post authentication plugins can for example store information about the
    authentication in the user's profile, or call another system for audit
    logging purposes.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Policy evaluation plugins implement new policy conditions, send
    attributes from the user profile as part of a policy response, extend the
    definition of the subjects to whom the policy applies, or customize how
    policy management is delegated.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Identity repository plugins let OpenAM employ a new or custom user
    data store, other than a directory server or JDBC-accessible
    database.</para>

 <section xml:id="openam-ipv">
 <title>OpenAM, IPv4, and IPv6</title>
  <para>OpenAM provides functionality for IPv4, IPv6, and a hybrid of the two. 
  While the majority of the interaction is done on the backend, there are a few
  places where the GUI requires some inputs, such as setting up policy conditions.
  These areas follow the same standard that applies to IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 uses a 32-bit 
  integer value, with a dot-decimal system. IPv6 uses a hexadecimal system, and the eight 
  groups of hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon.<!--If you elect to use a hybrid of 
  the two, use a colon for the first portion of the address to indicate it is part fo the 
  IPv6 standard, and periods for the remaining fields that should be IPv4.--></para>
