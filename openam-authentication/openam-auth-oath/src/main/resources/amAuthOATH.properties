authentication=Authentication Modules
iPlanetAMAuthOATHServiceDescription=OATH
a500=Authentication Level
a500.help=The authentication level associated with this module.
a500.help.txt=Each authentication module has an authentication level that can be used to indicate the level of security \
associated with the module; 0 is the lowest (and the default).
a501=One Time Password Length 
a501.help=The length of the generated OTP in digits. Must be 6 digits or longer.
a502=Minimum Secret Key Length
a502.help=Number of hexadecimal characters allowed for the Secret Key.
a503=Secret Key Attribute Name
a503.help=The name of the attribute in the user profile to store the user secret key.
a504=OATH Algorithm to Use
a504.help=Choose the algorithm your device uses to generate the OTP.
a504.help.txt= HOTP uses a counter value that is incremented every time a new OTP is generated. TOTP generates a new OTP every few seconds as specified by the time step interval.
a505=HOTP Window Size
a505.help=The size of the window to resynchronize with the client.
a505.help.txt=This sets the window that the OTP device and the server counter can be out of sync. For example, if the window size is 100 and the servers last successful login was at counter value 2, then the server will accept a OTP from the OTP device that is from device counter 3 to 102.
a506=Counter Attribute Name
a506.help=The name of the attribute in the user profile to store the user counter. This is required if HOTP is chosen as the OATH algorithm.
a507=Add Checksum Digit
a507.help=This adds a checksum digit to the OTP.
a507.help.txt=This adds a digit to the end of the OTP generated to be used as a checksum to verify the OTP was generated correctly. This is in addition to the actual password length. You should only set this if your device supports it.
a508=Truncation Offset
a508.help=This adds an offset to the generation of the OTP.
a508.help.txt=This is an option used by the HOTP algorithm that not all devices support. This should be left default unless you know your device uses a offset.
a509=TOTP Time Step Interval
a509.help= The TOTP time step in seconds that the OTP device uses to generate the OTP.
a509.help.txt=This is the time interval that one OTP is valid for. For example, if the time step is 30 seconds, then a new OTP will be generated every 30 seconds. This makes a single OTP valid for only 30 seconds.
a510=TOTP Time Steps
a510.help=The number of time steps to check before and after receiving a OTP.
a510.help.txt=This is the number of time step intervals to check the received OTP against both forward in time and back in time. For example, with 2 time steps and a time step interval of 30 seconds the server will allow a clock drift between client and server of 89 seconds. (2-30 second steps and 29 seconds for the interval that the OTP arrived in)
a511=Last Login Time Attribute
a511.help=Attribute to store the time of the users last login. This is required if TOTP is chosen as the OATH algorithm.
a511.help.txt=This attribute stores the last time a user logged in to prevent time based attacks. The value is stored as a number (Unix Time).
HOTP=HOTP
TOTP=TOTP
