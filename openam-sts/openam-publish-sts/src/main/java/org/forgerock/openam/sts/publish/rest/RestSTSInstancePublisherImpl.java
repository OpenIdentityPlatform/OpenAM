 * publishedRoutes, and call putIfAbsent, but that would require first adding the Route to the router, and rolling-back
 * these operations in the case of failure (i.e. removing the route from the router). Because publishing rest-sts instances
 * will occur infrequently, synchronizing both of these actions seemed a better trade-off to insure consistent, non-interleaved
 * mutations of all stateful elements involved with publishing a rest-sts instance.

        Looking at the router.add code to determine what happens if route already exists: it looks like it amounts to a no-op -
        the backing route collection is a CopyOnWriteArraySet, which will just return false if the add did not work, but
        because this value is not returned, we don't know what the outcome of the operation was. But because the Route class
        is contained in the CoWAS, and it does not over-ride the equals method, every new reference to a Route will be added -
        i.e. equality is defined as reference equality. So it seems possible to add the same path several times, and the
        specific SingletonResourceProvider chosen to service a given request is a function of the RouteMatcher.

        But because it should not be possible to add a new rest-sts instance at the same path, I can avoid all of these
        complexities by checking my HashMap if an entry is present, as I need to maintain a reference to all
