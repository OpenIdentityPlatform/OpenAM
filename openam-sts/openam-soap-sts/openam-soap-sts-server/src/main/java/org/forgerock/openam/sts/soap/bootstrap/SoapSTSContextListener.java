 * This class will shutdown the soap-sts state related to polling the sts-publish service in order to
 * expose soap-sts instances published on the OpenAM home server.
 * The contextInitialized method will not be leveraged for initializing this process because
 * contextInitialized is called prior to the Servlet is actually initialized, and thus referencing the SoapSTSInjectorHolder,
 * and thereby triggering the global bindings, kicks-off the process of polling the sts-publish service, as part of exposing
 * published soap-sts instances. Part of this exposure involves referencing the cxf Bus set in the STSBroker#loadBus method,
 * this process cannot be initialized until after the STSBroker servlet has been initialized. Thus this initialization will
 * occur in the STSBroker#loadBus method, and the STSBroker servlet will be a load-on-startup servlet.
