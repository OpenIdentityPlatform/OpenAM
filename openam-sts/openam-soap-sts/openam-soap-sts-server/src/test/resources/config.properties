############### Configuration state necessary for the soap sts
### Note to Developers:
# Note that the values corresponding to the keys below will be over-written by the Soap STS Deployment Common Task.
# Note that the current values, as they currently exist in the source directory, should not be removed however,
# especially the am_deployment_url, as they are taken advantage of by the unit-test context to create an
# object graph corresponding to a live soap-sts deployment in the unit-test context. This is necessary in unit-tests
# which text higher-order functionality, like the SoapSTSInstancePublisherImplTest.
