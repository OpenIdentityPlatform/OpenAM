=== Understanding Identity Access Management

The proliferation of cloud-based technologies, mobile devices, social networks, Big Data, enterprise applications, and business-to-business (B2B) services has spurred the exponential growth of identity information, which is often stored in varied and widely-distributed identity environments.

The challenges of securing such identity data and the environments that depend on the identity data are daunting. Organizations that expand their services in-house or globally through internal development or through acquisitions must manage identities across wide spectrum of identity infrastructures. This expansion requires a careful integration of acquisitions must manage identities across a wide spectrum of identity infrastructures. This expansion requires a careful integration of disparate access management systems, platform-dependent architectures with limited scalability, and ad-hoc security components.

Identity Management is the automated provisioning, updating, and de-provisioning of identities over their lifecycles. Access Management is the authentication and authorization of identities who desire privileged access to an organization's resources. Access management encompasses the central auditing of operations performed on the system by customers, employees, and partners. Access management also provides the means to share identity data across different access management systems, legacy implementations, and networks.

[#am-server-overview]
=== OpenAM Server Overview

OpenAM is an open source centralized access management server, securing protected resources across the network and providing authentication, authorization, Web security, and federation services in a single, integrated solution. OpenAM manages access to the protected resources by controlling who has access, when, how long, and under what conditions by centralizing disparate hardware and software services for cloud, enterprise, mobile, and business-to-business (B2B) systems.

xref:#figure-openam-apis["OpenAM Architecture"] illustrates the OpenAM architecture.

[#figure-openam-apis]
image::images/openam-architecture-dpg.png[]
OpenAM features a highly modular and flexible architecture with multiple plugin points to meet any customer deployment. It leverages industry standard protocols, such as HTTP, XML, SOAP, REST, SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect 1.0, and so forth to deliver a high performance, highly scalable, and highly available access management solution over the network. OpenAM services are 100% Java-based, proven across multiple platforms and containers in many production deployments.

OpenAM core server can be deployed and integrated within existing network infrastructures. OpenAM provides the following distribution files:

[#table-openam-distribution-files]
.OpenAM Distribution Files

a|ClientSDK-{openam-version}.jar
a|OpenAM's default distribution `.war` file includes the core server code with an embedded OpenDJ directory server, which stores configuration data and simplifies deployments. The distribution includes an administrative graphical user interface (GUI) Web console. During installation, the `.war` file accesses a bootstrap file to obtain the fully qualified domain name, port, context path, and the location of the configuration folder. OpenAM provides a client SDK for developers to code extensions for their web applications to access OpenAM's services. The client SDK contains the Java packages, classes, property files, and sample code to help you develop your code.

a|ExampleClientSDK-CLI-{openam-version}.zip
a|OpenAM provides client SDK examples to help you run them on OpenAM. The `zip` distribution file contains setup scripts and samples that you can run to learn how to use the client SDK.

a|ExampleClientSDK-WAR-{openam-version}.war
a|The example client SDK also comes in a `.war` file, which installs on your container.

a|Fedlet-{openam-version}.zip
a|OpenAM provides a core server-only `.war` file without the OpenAM Console. This setup is often used in multi-server deployments wherein the deployments is managed using a full server instance using the `ssoadm` command-line tool. The OpenAM server installs with an embedded OpenDJ directory server. OpenAM provides an OpenAM Fedlet, a light-weight SAML v2.0 service provider. The Fedlet lets you set up a federated deployment without the need of a fully-featured service provider.
