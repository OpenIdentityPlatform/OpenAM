[#chap-jee-agent-config]
== Configuring Java EE Policy Agents

You install policy agents in web servers and web application containers to enforce access policies OpenAM applies to protected web sites and web applications. Policy agents depend on OpenAM for all authentication and authorization decisions. Their primary responsibility consists of enforcing what OpenAM decides in a way that is unobtrusive to the user. In organizations with many servers, you might well install many policy agents.

Policy agents can have local configurations where they are installed, but usually you store all policy agent configuration information in the OpenAM configuration store, defining policy agent profiles for each, and then letting the policy agents access their profiles through OpenAM such that you manage all agent configuration changes centrally. This chapter describes how to set up policy agent profiles in OpenAM for centralized configuration.

[#sec-configuration-location]
=== Configuration Location

Policy agent configuration properties can either be stored centrally in the OpenAM configuration store, or locally as a flat-file installed alongside the policy agent.

Policy agent configuration settings are stored centrally by default in the OpenAM configuration store, which allows you to configure your policy agents on the OpenAM console for easier management and convenience. Any property change made in OpenAM using the console or the `ssoadm` command-line tool is immediately communicated to the agent by using a notification. Many policy agent properties are hot-swap enabled, allowing the change to take effect immediately without a server restart.

Policy agent configuration settings can also be stored locally in a Java properties flatfile, such as `Agent_001/config/OpenSSOAgentConfiguration.properties`, which is created when you install the agent. If you choose to use a local properties file, you must make all configuration changes by modifying property values in the `OpenSSOAgentConfiguration.properties` file.


[#gateway-or-policy-agent]
=== OpenIG or Policy Agent?

OpenAM supports both link:http://openig.forgerock.org/[OpenIG, window=\_blank] and also a variety of policy agents. OpenIG and the policy agents can both enforce policy, redirecting users to authenticate when necessary, and controlling access to protected resources. OpenIG runs as a self-contained reverse proxy located between the users and the protected applications. Policy agents are installed into the servers where applications run, intercepting requests in that context.

Use OpenIG to protect access to applications not suited for a policy agent. Not all web servers and Java EE applications have policy agents. Not all operating systems work with policy agents.

Policy agents have the advantage of sitting within your existing server infrastructure. Once you have agents installed into the servers with web applications or sites to protect, then you can manage their configurations centrally from OpenAM.

For organizations with both servers on which you can install policy agents and also applications that you must protect without touching the server, you can use policy agents on the former and OpenIG for the latter.


[#kinds-of-agent-profiles]
=== Types of Agent

You can configure a number of different types of agents.

Each agent type requires an __agent profile__ in OpenAM. The agent profile contains essential configuration for agent operation, such as a password to authenticate the agent, and the URL the agent resides at. For agents that support it, the agent profile can store all agent configuration centrally, rather than locally on the agent server.

Web and J2EE policy agents are the most common, requiring the least integration effort. The available agent types are:
--

Web::
You install web agents in web servers to protect web sites.

J2EE::
You install J2EE agents in web application containers to protect web applications.

2.2 Agents::
Version 2.2 web and Java EE policy agents hold their configuration locally, connecting to OpenAM with a username/password combination. This agent type is provided for backwards compatibility.

OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Client::
Register OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect clients using this type of profile.

Agent Authenticator::
The agent authenticator can read agent profiles by connecting to OpenAM with a user name, password combination, but unlike the agent profile administrator, cannot change agent configuration.

SOAP STS Agent::
Secure requests to the SOAP Security Token Service using this type of agent profile.

--


[#create-agent-profiles]
=== Creating Agent Profiles

This section concerns creating agent profiles, and creating groups that let agents inherit settings when you have many agents with nearly the same profile settings.

[#create-agent-profile]
.To Create an Agent Profile
====
To create a new Java EE policy agent profile, you need to create a name and password for the agent. You also need the URLs to OpenAM and the application to protect:

. Login to OpenAM Console as an administrative user.

. On the Realms menu of the OpenAM console, select the realm in which the agent profile is to be managed.

. Click the Agents link, click the tab page for the kind of agent profile you want to create, and then click the New button in the Agent table.

. In the Name field, enter a name for the agent profile.

. In the Password and Re-Enter Password fields, enter a password for the new agent profile.

. Click `Local` or `Centralized` (Default) to determine where the agent properties are stored. If you select `Local`, the properties are stored on the server on which the agent is running. If you select `Centralized`, the properties are stored on the OpenAM server.

. In the Server URL field, enter the URL to OpenAM. For example, `\http://openam.example.com:8080/openam`.

. In the Agent URL field, enter the primary URL of the web or application server protected by the policy agent. For Java EE policy agents, an example URL must include the `agentapp` context: `\http://shop.example.com:28080/agentapp`.
+

[#figure-create-agent]
image::images/create-jee-agent-profile.png[]

. Click Create. After creating the agent profile, you can click the link to the new profile to adjust and export the configuration.

====

[#create-agent-group]
.To Create an Agent Profile Group and Inherit Settings
====
Agent profile groups let you set up multiple agents to inherit settings from the group. To create a new agent profile group, you need a name and the URL to the OpenAM server in which you store the profile:

. Login to OpenAM Console as an administrative user.

. On the Realms menu of the OpenAM console, Select the realm in which you manage agents.

. Click the Agents link, click the tab page for the kind of agent group you want to create, and then in the Group table, click New.
+
After creating the group profile, you can click the link to the new group profile to fine-tune or export the configuration.

. Inherit group settings by selecting your agent profile, and then selecting the group name in the Group drop-down list near the top of the profile page.
+
You can then adjust inheritance by clicking Inheritance Settings on the agent profile page.

====

[#create-agent-profile-cli]
.To Create an Agent Profile Using the Command Line
====
You can create a policy agent profile in OpenAM using the `ssoadm` command-line tool. You do so by specifying the agent properties either as a list of attributes, or by using an agent properties file as shown below. Export an existing policy agent configuration before you start to see what properties you want to set when creating the agent profile.

The following procedure demonstrates creating a policy agent profile using the `ssoadm` command:

. Make sure the `ssoadm` command is installed. See link:../../../openam/13/install-guide/#install-openam-admin-tools["To Set Up Administration Tools", window=\_blank] in the __OpenAM Installation Guide__.

. Determine the list of properties to set in the agent profile.
+
The following properties file shows a minimal configuration for a policy agent profile:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cat myAgent.properties
com.sun.identity.agents.config.agenturi.prefix=http://shop.example.com:28080/amagent
com.sun.identity.agents.config.cdsso.cdcservlet.url[0]= \
     https://openam.example.com:8080/openam/cdcservlet
com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.default=www.example.com
com.sun.identity.agents.config.login.url[0]= \
     http://openam.example.com:8080/openam/UI/Login
com.sun.identity.agents.config.logout.url[0]= \
     http://openam.example.com:8080/openam/UI/Logout
com.sun.identity.agents.config.remote.logfile=amAgent_shop_example_com_28080.log
com.sun.identity.agents.config.repository.location=centralized
com.sun.identity.client.notification.url= \
     http://www.example.com:80/UpdateAgentCacheServlet?shortcircuit=false
sunIdentityServerDeviceKeyValue[0]=agentRootURL=http://shop.example.com:28080/
sunIdentityServerDeviceStatus=Active
userpassword=password
----

. Set up a password file used when authenticating to OpenAM. The password file must be read-only for the user who creates the policy agent profile, and must not be accessible to other users:
+

[source, console]
----
$ echo password > /tmp/pwd.txt
$ chmod 400 /tmp/pwd.txt
----

. Create the profile in OpenAM:
+

[source, console]
----
$ ssoadm create-agent \
  --realm / \
  --agentname myAgent \
  --agenttype J2EE \
  --adminid amadmin
  --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt \
  --datafile myAgent.properties

Agent configuration was created.
----
+
At this point you can view the profile in OpenAM Console under Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents to make sure the configuration is what you expect.

====


[#delegate-agent-profile-creation]
=== Delegating Agent Profile Creation

If you want to create policy agent profiles when installing policy agents, then you need the credentials of an OpenAM user who can read and write agent profiles.

You can use the OpenAM administrator account when creating policy agent profiles. If you delegate policy agent installation, then you might not want to share OpenAM administrator credentials with everyone who installs policy agents.

[#create-agent-administrators]
.To Create Agent Administrators for a Realm
====
Follow these steps to create __agent administrator__ users for a realm:

. In OpenAM console, browse to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Subjects.

. Under Group click New... and create a group for agent administrators.

. Switch to the Privileges tab for the realm, and click the name of the group you created.

. Select Read and write access to all configured agents, and then Save your work.

. Return to the Subjects tab, and under User create as many agent administrator users as needed.

. For each agent administrator user, edit the user profile.
+
Under the Group tab of the user profile, add the user to agent profile administrator group, and then Save your work.

. Provide each system administrator who installs policy agents with their agent administrator credentials.
+
When installing the policy agent with the `--custom-install` option, the system administrator can choose the option to create the profile during installation, and then provide the agent administrator user name and the path to a read-only file containing the agent administrator password. For silent installs, you can add the `--acceptLicense` option to auto-accept the software license agreement.

====


[#configure-j2ee-policy-agent]
=== Configuring Java EE Policy Agent Properties

When you create a Java EE policy agent profile and install the agent, you can choose to store the agent configuration centrally and configure the agent through OpenAM console. Alternatively, you can store the agent configuration locally and configure the agent by changing values in the properties file. This section covers centralized configuration, indicating the corresponding properties for use in a local configuration file where applicable. footnote:d0e1238[The configuration file syntax is that of a standard Java properties file. Seelink:http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.Reader%29[java.util.Properties.load(), window=\_top]for a description of the format. The value of a property specified multiple times is not defined.]

[TIP]
====
To show the agent properties in configuration file format that correspond to what you see in the console, click Export Configuration after editing agent properties.
====
After changing properties specified as "Hot swap: no", you must restart the agent's container for the changes to take effect.

--
[#j2ee-agent-fqdn-properties]
.Fully Qualified Domain Name Checking Properties
--

FQDN Check::
Enables checking of FQDN default value and FQDN map values.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.check.enable`

FQDN Default::
FQDN users should use to access resources.

+
This property ensures that when users access protected resources on the web server without specifying the FQDN, the agent can redirect the users to URLs containing the correct FQDN.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.default`

FQDN Virtual Host Map::
Maps virtual, invalid, or partial hostnames, and IP addresses to the FQDN to access protected resources. The property allows agents to redirect users to the FQDN and receive cookies belonging to the domain. It also ensures that invalid FQDN values that can cause the application server to become unusable or render resources inaccessible get properly mapped to the FQDN.

+
The property accepts an __invalid_hostname__ and a __validN__ Map Key value. The __invalid_hostname__ maps an invalid or a partial hostname, or an IP address to a FQDN. The __validN__ (where N = 1, 2, 3 ...) Map Key maps virtual hostnames to a FQDN.
+

[source]
----
com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[invalid_hostname] = valid_hostname
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[validN] = valid_hostname
----
+
For example, to map the partial hostname `myserver` to `myserver.mydomain.example`, enter `myserver` in the Map Key field, enter `myserver.mydomain.example` in the Corresponding Map Value field and then click Add. This corresponds to:
+

[source]
----
com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[myserver] = myserver.mydomain.example
----
+
To address a server as `xyz.hostname.com`, when the actual name of the server is `abc.hostname.com`, enter `valid1` in the Map Key field, enter `xyz.hostname.example` in the Corresponding Map Value field and then click Add. This corresponds to:
+

[source]
----
com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid1] = xyz.hostname.com
----
+
If you have multiple virtual servers `rst.hostname.com`, `uvw.hostname.com`, and `xyz.hostname.com` pointing to the same actual server `abc.hostname.com` and each virtual server has its own policies defined, the properties can be defined as:
+

[source]
----
com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid1] = rst.hostname.com
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid2] = uvw.hostname.com
      com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[valid3] = xyz.hostname.com

[#j2ee-agent-not-enforced-uri-properties]
.Not Enforced URI Processing Properties
--

Not Enforced URIs::
List of URIs for which no authentication is required, and the agent does not protect access. You can use wildcards to define a pattern for a URI.

+
The `*` wildcard matches all characters except question mark (`?`), cannot be escaped, and spans multiple levels in a URI. Multiple forward slashes do not match a single forward slash, so `*` matches `mult/iple/dirs`, yet `mult/*/dirs` does not match `mult/dirs`.

+
The `-*-` wildcard matches all characters except forward slash (`/`) or question mark (`?`), and cannot be escaped. As it does not match `/`, `-*-` does not span multiple levels in a URI.

+
OpenAM does not let you mix `*` and `-*-` in the same URI.

+
Examples include `/logout.html`, `/images/*`, `/css/-*-`, and `/*.jsp?locale=*`.

+
Trailing forward slashes are not recognized as part of a resource name. Therefore `/images//` and `/images` are equivalent.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri`

Invert Not Enforced URIs::
Only enforce not enforced list of URIs. In other words, enforce policy only for those URIs and patterns specified in the list.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri.invert`

Not Enforced URIs Cache Enabled::
When enabled, the agent caches evaluation of the not enforced URI list.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri.cache.enable`

Not Enforced URIs Cache Size::
When caching is enabled, this limits the number of not enforced URIs cached.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.uri.cache.size`

+
Default: 1000

Refresh Session Idle Time::
When enabled, the agent resets the stateful session idle time when granting access to a not enforced URI, prolonging the time before the user must authenticate again. This setting has no effect on users with stateless sessions.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.refresh.session.idletime`

[#j2ee-agent-login-url-properties]
.Login URL Properties
--

OpenAM Login URL::
OpenAM login page URL, such as `\http://openam.example.com:8080/openam/UI/Login`, to which the agent redirects incoming users without sufficient credentials so that they can authenticate. If CDSSO is enabled, this property is not used, instead the CDCServlet URL will be used.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.login.url`

OpenAM Conditional Login URL (Not yet in OpenAM console)::
To conditionally redirect users based on the incoming request URL, set this property.

+
This takes the incoming request domain to match, a vertical bar ( `|` ), and then a comma-separated list of URLs to which to redirect incoming users.

+
If the domain before the vertical bar matches an incoming request URL, then the policy agent uses the list of URLs to determine how to redirect the user-agent. If the global property FQDN Check (`com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.check.enable`) is enabled for the policy agent, then the policy agent iterates through the list until it finds an appropriate redirect URL that matches the FQDN check. Otherwise, the policy agent redirects the user-agent to the first URL in the list.

+
Property: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.conditional.login.url`

+
Examples: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.conditional.login.url[0]= login.example.com|http://openam1.example.com/openam/UI/Login, http://openam2.example.com/openam/UI/Login`, `com.sun.identity.agents.config.conditional.login.url[1]= signin.example.com|http://openam3.example.com/openam/UI/Login, http://openam4.example.com/openam/UI/Login`

+
If CDSSO is enabled for the policy agent, then this property takes CDSSO Servlet URLs for its values (`com.sun.identity.agents.config.cdsso.cdcservlet.url`), rather than OpenAM login URLs.

+
CDSSO examples: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.conditional.login.url[0]= login.example.com|http://openam1.example.com/openam/cdcservlet, http://openam2.example.com/openam/cdcservlet`, `com.sun.identity.agents.config.conditional.login.url[1]= signin.example.com|http://openam3.example.com/openam/cdcservlet, http://openam4.example.com/openam/cdcservlet`

[#chap-lb]
=== Configuring Java EE Policy Agents Behind Load Balancers

This chapter provides information about configuring policy agents on protected application servers that operate behind network load balancers.

[#lb-scenarios]
==== The Role of the Load Balancing Layer

A load balancing layer that stands between clients and protected servers can distribute the client load, and fail client traffic over when a protected server goes offline. In the simplest case, the load balancing layer passes requests from the clients to servers and responses from servers to clients, managing the traffic so the client experience is as smooth as possible.

[#figure-lb-jee-agents]
image::images/lb-jee-agents.png[]
A load balancing layer can also offload processor-intensive public-key encryption algorithms involved in SSL transactions to a hardware accelerator, reducing the load on the protected servers. The client connects to the load balancer over HTTPS, but the load balancer connects to the servers over HTTP.

[#figure-lb-jee-agents-ssl-offload]
image::images/lb-jee-agents-ssl-offload.png[]


[#lb-configure-agent]
==== Configuring the Agent Behind the Load Balancer

Configure your agent to map the agent host name to the load balancer host name, and to set alternate agent URL properties. Follow the steps in xref:#lb-fqdn-mapping[To Map the Agent Host Name to the Load Balancer Host Name] and xref:#lb-alternate-agent-url[To Set Alternate Agent URL Properties].

[#lb-fqdn-mapping]
.To Map the Agent Host Name to the Load Balancer Host Name
====
This procedure explains how to do so for a centralized Java EE policy agent profile configured in OpenAM Console. The steps also mention the properties for Java EE agent profiles that rely on local, file-based configurations:

. Login to OpenAM Console as an administrative user with rights to modify the policy agent profile.

. Browse to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > J2EE > __Agent Name__ to open the Java EE agent profile for editing.

. In the Global tab page section Fully Qualified Domain Name Checking, make sure FQDN checking is selected (the default).
+
The equivalent property setting is `com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.check.enable=true`.

. Set FQDN Default to the fully qualified domain name of the load balancer, such as `lb.example.com`, rather than the protected server FQDN where the policy agent is installed.
+
The equivalent property setting is `com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.default=lb.example.com`.

. Set FQDN Virtual Host Map to map the protected server FQDN to the load balancer FQDN, for example, where the key `agent.example.com` (protected server) has value `lb.example.com` (load balancer).
+
The equivalent property setting is `com.sun.identity.agents.config.fqdn.mapping[agent.example.com]=lb.example.com`.

. Save your work, and then restart the agent or the protected server.

====

[#lb-alternate-agent-url]
.To Set Alternate Agent URL Properties
====
Use the alternate agent URL properties to show the load balancer protocol, host, and port to show client browsers.

This procedure explains how to do so for a centralized Java EE policy agent profile configured in OpenAM Console. The steps also mention the properties for Java EE agent profiles that rely on local, file-based configurations.

. Login to OpenAM Console as an administrative user with rights to modify the policy agent profile.

. Browse to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > J2EE > __Agent Name__ to open the Java EE agent profile for editing.

. In the Advanced tab page section Alternate Agent URL, set the Alternative Agent Host Name to that of the load balancer. such as `lb`.
+
The equivalent property setting is similar to the following: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.agent.host=lb`.

. If the host name is different on the load balancer, in the Advanced tab page section Alternate Agent URL, set the Alternative Agent Port number to that of the load balancer, such as `80`.
+
The equivalent property setting is similar to the following: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.agent.port=80`.

. If the protocol is different on the load balancer, in the Advanced tab page section Alternate Agent URL, set the Alternative Agent Protocol to either `http` or `https`.
+
The equivalent property setting is similar to the following: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.agent.protocol=https`.

. Save your work, and then restart the agent or the protected server.

====



[#configure-agent-auth]
=== Configuring Agent Authenticators

An __agent authenticator__ has read-only access to multiple agent profiles defined in the same realm, typically allowing an agent to read web service agent profiles.

After creating the agent profile, you access agent properties in the OpenAM console under Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Agent Authenticator > __Agent Name__.
--

Password::
Specifies the password the agent uses to connect to OpenAM.

Status::
Specifies whether the agent profile is active, and so can be used.

Agent Profiles allowed to Read::
Specifies which agent profiles in the realm the agent authenticator can read.

Agent Root URL for CDSSO::
Specifies the list of agent root URLs for CDSSO. The valid value is in the format `protocol://hostname:port/` where __protocol__ represents the protocol used, such as `http` or `https`, __hostname__ represents the host name of the system where the agent resides, and __port__ represents the port number on which the agent is installed. The slash following the port number is required.

+
If your agent system also has virtual host names, add URLs with the virtual host names to this list as well. OpenAM checks that `goto` URLs match one of the agent root URLs for CDSSO.

--


[#configuring-declarative-security]
=== Configuring Container Declarative Security

In addition to the policy agent's protection, some applications in your environment may require role-based access control at container level. For example, you may want to only allow authenticated members of the `manager` group defined in the user data store to access certain servlets and JSP pages.

[#declarative-security-overview]
==== Introducing Declarative Security

The Java EE security model is declarative; it describes roles and permissions in the `web.xml` file of each application, isolating the security component from the application code.

An application configured for declarative security contains `<security-constraint>` elements in its `web.xml` file. Consider the following example:

[source, console]
----
<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
     <web-resource-name>Protected Servlet</web-resource-name>
     <url-pattern>/protectedservlet</url-pattern>
  </web-resource-collection>
  <auth-constraint>
     <role-name>id=manager,ou=group,dc=openam,dc=forgerock,dc=org</role-name>
   </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
----

* The `<web-resource-collection>` element defines the protected resource: `/protectedservlet`.

* The `<auth-constraint>` element defines the rule that constrains user access: only members of the group `id=manager,ou=group,dc=openam,dc=forgerock,dc=org` can access the `/protectedservlet` servlet.

When the container gets a request for a resource protected by declarative security, it prompts the user to log in using the page specified in the `<form-login-page>` element of the `web.xml` file. For example:

[source, console]
----
<form-login-config>
  <form-login-page>/authentication/login.html</form-login-page>
  <form-error-page>/authentication/accessdenied.html</form-error-page>
</form-login-config>
----
If the user does not satisfy the security requirements for the application, the container redirects the user to the page specified by the `<form-error-page>` element.

[TIP]
====
For more details on declarative security elements, see the following:

* Refer to the documentation of your Java EE version and your container. Some containers may implement security in different ways.

* Consider deploying the `agentsample.war` sample application contained in the Java EE policy agent distribution. The sample application demonstrates declarative security concepts.
+
Once you deploy the sample application in a container, see the `/j2ee_agents/agent_type/sampleapp/readme.txt` file for instructions.

====


[#configuring-agent-for-declarative-security]
==== Configuring the Java EE Policy Agent for Declarative Security

When configuring an application with declarative security to work alongside a Java EE policy agent, the agent acts as an additional layer of security between the user and the protected resource. The following sequence diagram shows the high-level flow of a request for a resource passing through the policy agent and the declarative security layer when the policy agent's link:#filter-modes[filter mode] is configured as `ALL`.

[#figure-agent-declarative-security-flow]
image::images/agent-declarative-security-flow.png[]
If the policy agent's filter mode was set to `J2EE_POLICY`, the diagram's flow would have ended at step 8), after the check on declarative security.

To configure the Java EE policy agent to work with the container's declarative security, perform the steps in the following procedure:

[#configure-agent-for-declarative-security]
.To Configure the Policy Agent for Declarative Security
====
This procedure assumes you have already installed a policy agent and that it is configured to protect the application. To configure the agent for declarative security, perform the following steps:

. Ensure that the application `<login-config>` element is configured, and that its `<auth-method>` element is set to `FORM`. For example:
+

[source, console]
----
<login-config>
  <auth-method>FORM</auth-method>
  <form-login-config>
     <form-login-page>/authentication/login.html</form-login-page>
     <form-error-page>/authentication/accessdenied.html</form-error-page>
  </form-login-config>
</login-config>
----
+
Consider the following points:
+

* By default, the policy agent is configured to handle the login process without honoring the value of the `<form-login-page>` element. This allows for the configuration of declarative security for applications that are not designed to use the `FORM` login mechanism. Therefore, these applications can define a dummy value for the `<form-login-page>` element.

* The `<form-error-page>` element is mandatory. It is the page where the container redirects users that do not satisfy OpenAM policies and declarative security rules. If this page does not exist, a 404 error may display.


. In the OpenAM console, navigate to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > J2EE > __Agent Name__, and select the General tab.

. Ensure that the Agent Filter Mode property value is either `ALL` or `J2EE_POLICY`.

. In the OpenAM console, navigate to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > J2EE > __Agent Name__, and select the Application tab.

. Configure the Login Form URI property using the value of the `<form-login-page>` element. For example, `/HR/authentication/login.html`.
+
Note that the agent requires the URI context to be specified as part of the login form, in this case, `/HR/`.

. Configure the Login Error URI property using the value of the `<form-error-page>` element. For example, `/HR/authentication/accessdenied.html`.
+
Note that the agent requires the URI context to be specified as part of the login form, in this case, `/HR/`.

. Save your changes.

. Configure mappings to the roles required for declarative security. For more information, see xref:#j2ee-agent-privilege-attributes-properties[Privilege Attributes Processing Properties].
+

[TIP]
======
The sample application distributed with the policy agent, `agentsample.war`, contains an example about how to configure some of these properties.
