[#chap-extending]
== Extending OpenAM

OpenAM services solve a wide range of access and federation management problems out of the box. Yet, OpenAM also exposes APIs and SPIs that enable you extend OpenAM services when built-in functionality does not fit your deployment.

This part of the guide covers OpenAM mechanisms for plugging in additional functionality not available out of the box.

[#sec-post-auth]
=== Creating a Post Authentication Plugin

Post authentication plugins (PAP) let you include custom processing at the end of the authentication process, immediately before the subject is authenticated. Common uses of post authentication plugins include setting cookies and session variables. Post authentication plugins are often used in conjunction with policy agents. The post authentication plugin sets custom session properties, and then the policy agent injects the custom properties into the request header to the protected application.

Two issues should be considered when writing a post authentication plugin for an OpenAM deployment that uses stateless sessions:
--

Cookie size::
You can set an unlimited number of session properties in a post authentication plugin. When OpenAM creates a stateless session, it writes the session properties into the session cookie, increasing the size of the cookie. Very large session cookies can exceed browser limitations. Therefore, when implementing a post authentication plugin in a deployment with stateless sessions, be sure to monitor the session cookie size and verify that you have not exceeded browser cookie size limits.

+
For more information about stateless session cookies, see xref:../admin-guide/chap-session-state.adoc#session-state-cookies["Session Cookies"] in the __Administration Guide__.

Cookie security::
The OpenAM administrator secures custom session properties residing on the OpenAM server for stateful sessions by using firewalls and other typical security techniques.

+
However, when using stateless sessions, custom session properties are written in cookies and reside on end users' systems. Cookies can be long-lasting and might represent a security issue if any session properties are of a sensitive nature. When developing a post authentication plugin for a deployment that uses stateless sessions, be sure that you are aware of the measures securing the session contained within the cookie.

+
For more information about stateless session cookie security, see xref:../admin-guide/chap-session-state.adoc#session-state-stateless-cookie-security["Stateless Session Cookie Security"] in the __Administration Guide__.

This section explains how to create a post authentication plugin.

[#design-post-authentication-plugin]
==== Designing Your Post Authentication Plugin

Your post authentication plugin class implements the `AMPostAuthProcessInterface` interface, and in particular the following three methods.

[source, java]
----
public void onLoginSuccess(
  Map requestParamsMap,
  HttpServletRequest request,
  HttpServletResponse response,
  SSOToken token
) throws AuthenticationException

public void onLoginFailure(
  Map requestParamsMap,
  HttpServletRequest request,
  HttpServletResponse response
) throws AuthenticationException

public void onLogout(
  HttpServletRequest request,
  HttpServletResponse response,
  SSOToken token
) throws AuthenticationException
----
OpenAM calls the `onLoginSuccess()` and `onLoginFailure()` methods immediately before informing the user of login success or failure, respectively. OpenAM calls the `onLogout()` method only when the user actively logs out, not when a user's session times out.

See the link:../apidocs[OpenAM Java SDK API Specification, window=\_blank] for reference.

These methods can perform whatever processing you require. Yet, know that OpenAM calls your methods synchronously as part of the authentication process. Therefore, if your methods take a long time to complete, you will keep users waiting. Minimize the processing done in your post authentication methods.


[#build-post-authentication-plugin]
==== Building Your Sample Post Authentication Plugin

The following example post authentication plugin sets a session property during successful login, writing to its debug log if the operation fails.

[source, java]
----
package com.forgerock.openam.examples;

import java.util.Map;

import com.iplanet.sso.SSOException;
import com.iplanet.sso.SSOToken;

import com.sun.identity.authentication.spi.AMPostAuthProcessInterface;
import com.sun.identity.authentication.spi.AuthenticationException;
import com.sun.identity.shared.debug.Debug;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class SamplePAP implements AMPostAuthProcessInterface {
    private final static String PROP_NAME = "MyProperty";
    private final static String PROP_VALUE = "MyValue";
    private final static String DEBUG_FILE = "SamplePAP";

    protected Debug debug = Debug.getInstance(DEBUG_FILE);

    public void onLoginSuccess(
            Map requestParamsMap,
            HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response,
            SSOToken token
    ) throws AuthenticationException {
        try {
            token.setProperty(PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE);
        } catch (SSOException e) {
            debug.error("Unable to set property");
        }
    }

    public void onLoginFailure(
            Map requestParamsMap,
            HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response
    ) throws AuthenticationException {
        // Not used
    }

    public void onLogout(
            HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response,
            SSOToken token
    ) throws AuthenticationException {
        // Not used
    }
}

--

`pom.xml`::
Apache Maven project file for the module

This file specifies how to build the sample post authentication plugin, and also specifies its dependencies on OpenAM components and on the Servlet API.

`src/main/java/com/forgerock/openam/examples/SamplePAP.java`::
Core class for the sample post authentication plugin

[#configure-post-authentication-plugin]
==== Configuring Your Post Authentication Plugin

You can associate post authentication plugins with realms or services (authentication chains). Where you configure the plugin depends on the scope to which the plugin should apply:

* Plugins configured at the realm level are executed when authenticating to any authentication chain in the realm, provided the authentication chain does not have an associated plugin.

* Plugins configured at the service level are executed if that authentication chain is used for authentication. Any plugins configured at the realm level will not execute.

In OpenAM Console, navigate to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Authentication > Settings > Post Authentication Processing. In the Authentication Post Processing Classes list, add the sample plugin class, `com.forgerock.openam.examples.SamplePAP`, and then click Save.

Alternatively, you can configure sample plugin for the realm by using the `ssoadm` command.

[source, console]
----
$ ssoadm
  set-svc-attrs
  --adminid amadmin
  --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt
  --servicename iPlanetAMAuthService
  --realm /myRealm
  --attributevalues iplanet-am-auth-post-login-process-class=
  com.forgerock.openam.examples.SamplePAP

iPlanetAMAuthService under /myRealm was
  modified.
----


[#test-post-authentication-plugin]
==== Testing Your Post Authentication Plugin

To test the sample post authentication plugin, login successfully to OpenAM in the scope where the plugin is configured. For example, if you configured your plugin for the realm, `/myRealm`, specify the realm in the login URL.

[source]
----
http://openam.example.com:8080/openam/UI/Login?realm=myRealm
----
Although as a user you do not notice anywhere in the user interface that OpenAM calls your plugin, a policy agent or custom client code could retrieve the session property that your plugin added to the user session.
