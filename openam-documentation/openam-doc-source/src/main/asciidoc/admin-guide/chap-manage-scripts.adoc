[#chap-manage-scripts]
== Managing Scripts

This chapter shows you how to manage scripts used for client-side and server-side scripted authentication, custom policy conditions, and handling OpenID Connect claims using the OpenAM console and the `ssoadm` command.

For information on managing scripts by using the OpenAM REST API, see xref:../dev-guide/chap-client-dev.adoc#sec-manage-scripts-rest["RESTful Script Management"] in the __Developer's Guide__. For information on configuring Scripting Service settings, see xref:../reference/chap-config-ref.adoc#scripting-configuration["Scripting"] in the __Reference__.

[#managing-scripts-cli]
=== Managing Scripts With the ssoadm Command

Use the `ssoadm` command's `create-sub-cfg`, `get-sub-cfg`, and `delete-sub-cfg` subcommands to manage OpenAM scripts.

Create an OpenAM script as follows:

. Create a script configuration file as follows:
+

[source]
----
script-file=/path/to/script-file
language=JAVASCRIPT|GROOVY
name=myScript
context=AUTHENTICATION_SERVER_SIDE|AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_SIDE|POLICY_CONDITION|OIDC_CLAIMS
----

. Run the `ssoadm create-sub-cfg` command. The `--datafile` argument references the script configuration file you created in the previous step:
+

[source, console]
----
$ ssoadm \
create-sub-cfg \
--realm /myRealm \
--adminid amadmin \
--password-file /tmp/pwd.txt \
--servicename ScriptingService \
--subconfigname scriptConfigurations/scriptConfiguration \
--subconfigid myScript \
--datafile /path/to/myScriptConfigurationFile
Sub Configuration scriptConfigurations/scriptConfiguration was added to realm /myRealm
----

To list the properties of a script, run the `ssoadm get-sub-cfg` command:

[source, console]
----
$ ssoadm \
get-sub-cfg \
--realm /myRealm \
--adminid amadmin \
--password-file /tmp/pwd.txt \
--servicename ScriptingService \
--subconfigname scriptConfigurations/myScript
createdBy=
lastModifiedDate=
lastModifiedBy=
name=myScript
context=POLICY_CONDITION
description=
language=JAVASCRIPT
creationDate=
script=...Script output follows...
----
To delete a script, run the `ssoadm delete-sub-cfg` command:

[source, console]
----
$ ssoadm \
delete-sub-cfg \
--realm /myRealm \
--adminid amadmin \
--password-file /tmp/pwd.txt \
--servicename ScriptingService \
--subconfigname scriptConfigurations/myScript
Sub Configuration scriptConfigurations/myScript was deleted from realm /myRealm
----
