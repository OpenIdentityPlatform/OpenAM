[#chap-uma]
== Managing UMA Authorization

This chapter introduces link:https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home[User-Managed Access (UMA) 1.0, window=\_blank], and the part OpenAM plays in the UMA workflow. UMA 1.0 is a profile of OAuth 2.0.

[#sec-uma-intro]
=== OpenAM and the UMA Workflow

UMA defines a workflow for allowing resource owners to manage access to their protected resources by creating authorization policies on a centralized authorization server, such as OpenAM.

[#figure-uma-intro-workflow]
image::images/uma-workflow-overview.png[]
The actions that form the UMA workflow are as follows:
--

Manage::
The resource owner manages their resources on the resource server.

Protect::
The resource owner links their resource server and chosen authorization server, for example an OpenAM instance.
+

The authorization server provides a protection API so that the resource server can register sets of resources. Use of the protection API requires a protection API token (PAT) - an OAuth 2.0 token with a specific scope.
+
For more information, see xref:#managing-uma-resource-sets["Managing UMA Resource Sets"].

Control::
The resource owner controls who has access to their registered resources by creating policies on the authorization server.
+
For more information, see xref:#sec-uma-policies["Managing UMA Policies"].

Authorize::
The client, acting on behalf of the requesting party, uses the authorization server's authorization API to acquire a requesting party token (RPT). The requesting party or client may need further interaction with the authorization server at this point, for example to supply identity claims. Use of the authorization API requires an authorization API token (AAT) - an OAuth 2.0 token with a specific scope.

+
For more information, see xref:#accessing-uma-protected-resources["Accessing UMA-Protected Resources"].

Access::
The client presents the RPT to the resource server, which verifies its validity with the authorization server and, if both valid and containing sufficient permissions, returns the protected resource to the requesting party.

+
For more information, see xref:#accessing-uma-protected-resources["Accessing UMA-Protected Resources"].

=== Configuring OpenAM for UMA

This section explains how to setup OpenAM as an authorization server in the User-Managed Access (UMA) workflow.

[#configure-uma-provider]
==== Configuring the UMA Provider Service

To enable OpenAM to act as an authorization server in the UMA workflow, you must create an UMA Provider service.

[#to-configure-uma-provider-service]
.To Configure the UMA Provider Service
====

. In the OpenAM console, select Realms > __Realm Name__ > Dashboard > Configure OAuth Provider > Configure User Managed Access.

. On the Configure UMA page, select the Realm for the provider service.

. (Optional) If necessary, adjust the lifetimes for authorization codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens.

. (Optional) Select Issue Refresh Tokens unless you do not want the authorization service to supply a refresh token when returning an access token.

. (Optional) Select Issue Refresh Tokens on Refreshing Access Tokens if you want the authorization service to supply a new refresh token when refreshing an access token.

. (Optional) If you have a custom scope validator implementation, put it on the OpenAM classpath, for example `/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib/`, and specify the class name in the Scope Implementation Class field. For an example, see xref:../dev-guide/chap-customizing.adoc#sec-oauth2-scopes["Customizing OAuth 2.0 Scope Handling"] in the __Developer's Guide__.

. Click Create to save your changes. OpenAM creates the following:
+

* An UMA provider service.

* An OAuth2 provider service that supports OpenID Connect.

* A policy to protect the OAuth2 authorization endpoints.

+

[WARNING]
======
If an UMA provider service already exists, it will be overwritten with the new UMA parameter values.
======

. To access the provider service configuration in the OpenAM console, browse to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Services, and then click UMA Provider.
+
For information about the available attributes, see xref:../reference/chap-config-ref.adoc#uma-provider-configuration["UMA Provider"] in the __Reference__.
+
To complete the configuration, click Save Changes.

====


[#configure-uma-discovery]
==== Configuring OpenAM For UMA Discovery

OpenAM exposes an endpoint for discovering information about UMA Provider configuration.

To use the endpoint, you must first create both an OAuth 2.0 Provider service, and an UMA Provider service in OpenAM. For more information on creating these services, see xref:chap-oauth2.adoc#configure-oauth2-authz["Configuring the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Service"] and xref:#configure-uma-provider["Configuring the UMA Provider Service"].

A resource server or client can perform an HTTP GET on `/uma/{realm}/.well-known/uma-configuration` to retrieve a JSON object indicating the UMA Provider configuration for __realm__ if specified, or the Top Level Realm if not.

[TIP]
====
Resource servers and clients need to be able to discover the UMA provider for a resource owner. You should consider redirecting requests to URIs at the server root, such as `\http://www.example.com/.well-known/uma-configuration`, to the well-known URIs in OpenAM's space: `\http://www.example.com/openam/uma/.well-known/uma-configuration`.
====

[NOTE]
====
OpenAM supports a provider service that allows a realm to have a configured option for obtaining the base URL (including protocol) for components that need to return a URL to the client. This service is used to provide the URL base that is used in the `.well-known` endpoints used in OpenID Connect 1.0 and UMA.

For more information, see xref:../admin-guide/chap-openid-connect.adoc#configure-base-url-source["Configuring the Base URL Source Service"].
====
The following is an example of a GET request to the UMA configuration discovery endpoint for the Top Level Realm:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --request GET \

[#managing-uma-resource-sets]
=== Managing UMA Resource Sets

UMA resource servers register resource sets with the resource owner's chosen authorization server. Registered resources can then be protected, and are available for user-created policies.

OpenAM supports optional __system__ labels when registering resource sets to help resource owners organize their resources. For information on labelling resources, see xref:#managing-uma-resource-set-labels["Managing UMA Labels"].

OpenAM provides two REST endpoints for managing resource sets, as described in the sections below:

* xref:#managing-uma-resource-sets-with-REST-resource-servers["UMA Resource Set Endpoint for Resource Servers"]

* xref:#managing-uma-resource-sets-with-REST-users["UMA Resource Set Endpoint for Users"]


[#managing-uma-resource-sets-with-REST-resource-servers]
==== UMA Resource Set Endpoint for Resource Servers

OpenAM provides the `/oauth2/resource_set` REST endpoint, as described in the link:https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/draft-oauth-resource-reg.html[OAuth 2.0 Resource Set Registration, window=\_top] specification, to allow UMA resource servers to register and manage resource sets.

The endpoint requires a __Protection API Token__ (PAT), which is an OAuth 2.0 access token with a scope of `uma_protection`. A resource server must acquire a PAT in order to use the resource set endpoint. For more information, see xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

After acquiring a PAT, use the `/oauth2/resource_set` REST endpoint for the following operations:

* xref:#to-register-an-uma-resource-set["To Register an UMA Resource Set"]

* xref:#to-list-uma-resource-sets["To List Registered UMA Resource Sets"]

* xref:#to-read-an-uma-resource-set["To Read an UMA Resource Set"]

* xref:#to-update-an-uma-resource-set["To Update an UMA Resource Set"]

* xref:#to-delete-an-uma-resource-set["To Delete an UMA Resource Set"]


[#uma-acquire-pat]
.To Acquire a Protection API Token
====
You must have first xref:chap-oauth2.adoc#register-oauth2-client["Registering OAuth 2.0 Clients With the Authorization Service"] with a name, such as __UMA-Resource-Server__ and a client password, such as __password__. Ensure that `uma_protection` is in the list of available scopes in the client, and a redirection URI is configured:

. Direct the resource owner to the authorization server to obtain a PAT token. The URL should specify the client name registered above, the redirect URI, and request the `uma_protection` scope, as shown in the example below:
+
`\https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/oauth2/authorize?client_id=UMA-Resource-Server&redirect_uri=http://openam.example.com:8080&response_type=code&scope=uma_protection`
+
This example uses the OAuth 2.0 code grant, however the UMA resource server can use any of the OAuth 2.0 grants to obtain the access token.

. After logging in, the consent screen asks the resource owner to allow or deny the requested scopes.


[#figure-uma-resource-server-auth-request]
image::images/uma-resource-server-auth-request.png[]


. If the resource owner allows access, they are sent to the configured redirection URL, which will have a `code` query string parameter added, which is used to request the PAT.

. Create a POST request to the `/oauth2/access_token` endpoint, with the client credentials registered earlier, a grant type of `authorization_code`, a redirect URL, and the value of the `code` query string parameter returned in the previous step, as shown below:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --request POST \
 --data 'client_id=UMA-Resource-Server' \
 --data 'client_secret=password' \
 --data 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
 --data 'code=c1bb2b94-038b-4ab2-beb1-a1ee14790c6b' \
 --data 'redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fopenam.example.com%3A8080' \
 http://openam.example.com:8080/openam/oauth2/access_token

{
 "scope": "uma_protection read",
 "expires_in": 599,
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "refresh_token": "f9873041-885a-4522-836c-9fa71aaad3e4",
 "access_token": "983e1d96-20a7-437c-8432-cfde52076714"
}
----
+
The value returned in `access_token` is the PAT bearer token, used in the following procedures.

====

[#to-register-an-uma-resource-set]
.To Register an UMA Resource Set
====
To register a resource set, the resource server must first acquire a PAT token, as described in xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

Once you have the PAT bearer token, you can access the `/oauth2/resource_set` endpoint to register resources, as shown in the following steps.

* Create a POST request to the resource_set endpoint, including the PAT bearer token in an Authorization header.
+
The following example uses a PAT bearer token to register a photo album resource set and a pair of system labels:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --request POST \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer 515d6551-6512-5279-98b6-c0ef3f03a723" \

         "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/all"
     ],
     "labels" : [
         "3D",
         "VIP"
     ],
     "type" : "http://www.example.com/rsets/photoalbum"

}
----
+
The resource owner can then visit the user access policy URI in order to manage access to the resource set.

====

[#to-list-uma-resource-sets]
.To List Registered UMA Resource Sets
====
To list registered resource sets, you must first acquire a PAT token, as described in xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

Once you have the PAT token, you can access the `/oauth2/resource_set` endpoint to list resource sets, as shown below:

* Create a GET request to the resource_set endpoint, including the PAT bearer token in an Authorization header.
+
The following example uses a PAT bearer token to list the registered resource sets:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer 515d6551-6512-5279-98b6-c0ef3f03a723" \
 https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/oauth2/resource_set

    "8ed24623-fcb5-46b8-9a64-18ee1b9b7d5d0"
 ]
----
+
On success, an array of the registered resource set IDs is returned. Use the ID to identify a resource set in the following procedures:
+

** xref:#to-read-an-uma-resource-set["To Read an UMA Resource Set"]

** xref:#to-update-an-uma-resource-set["To Update an UMA Resource Set"]

** xref:#to-delete-an-uma-resource-set["To Delete an UMA Resource Set"]


====

[#to-read-an-uma-resource-set]
.To Read an UMA Resource Set
====
To read a resource set, you must first acquire a PAT token, as described in xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

Once you have the PAT token, you can access the `/oauth2/resource_set` endpoint to read resources, as shown below:

* Create a GET request to the resource_set endpoint, including the PAT bearer token in an Authorization header.
+

[NOTE]
======
You must provide the ID of the resource set to read, specified at the end of the request, as follows: `\https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/oauth2/resource_set/resource_set_ID`.

[#to-update-an-uma-resource-set]
.To Update an UMA Resource Set
====
To update a resource set, you must first acquire a PAT token, as described in xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

Once you have the PAT token, you can access the `/oauth2/resource_set` endpoint to update resources, as shown below:

* Create a PUT request to the resource_set endpoint, including the PAT bearer token in a header named `Authorization`, and any new or changed parameters.
+
The only difference between creating a resource set and updating one is the presence of an `If-Match` header when updating. This should contain the value of the ETag header returned when creating, updating, or reading a resource set.
+

[NOTE]
======
You must provide the ID of the resource set to update, specified at the end of the request, as follows: `\https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/oauth2/resource_set/resource_set_ID`.
======

.To Delete an UMA Resource Set
====
To delete a resource set, you must first acquire a PAT token, as described in xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

Once you have the PAT token, you can access the `/oauth2/resource_set` endpoint to delete resources, as shown below:

* Create a DELETE request to the resource_set endpoint, including the PAT bearer token in a header named `Authorization`.
+
Add an `If-Match` header containing the value of the ETag header returned when creating, updating, or reading a resource set.
+

[NOTE]
======
You must provide the ID of the resource set to read, specified at the end of the request, as follows: `\https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/oauth2/resource_set/resource_set_ID`.
======
+
The following example uses a PAT bearer token, a resource set ID and an If-Match header to delete a specific resource set:

[#managing-uma-resource-set-labels]
=== Managing UMA Labels

Apply labels to resources to help organize and locate them more easily. Resources can have multiple labels applied to them, and labels can apply to multiple resources.

Resources support three types of label:

User Labels::

* Managed by the resource owner after the resource set has been registered to them.

* Can be created and deleted. Deleting a label does not delete the resources to which it was applied.

* Support nested hierarchies. Separate levels of the hierarchy with forward slashes (*/*) when creating a label. For example `Top Level/Second Level/My Label`.

* Are only visible to the user who created them.

+
You can manage user labels by using the OpenAM console, or by using a REST interface. For more information, see xref:#managing-uma-labels-with-REST-users["UMA Labels Endpoint for Users"] and xref:#to-apply-user-labels-to-resource-sets["To Apply User Labels to a Resource"].

System Labels::
+
--
* Created by the resource server when registering a resource set.

* Cannot be deleted.

* Do not support a hierarchy of levels.

* Are only visible to the owner of the resource.

[NOTE]
======
Each resource set is automatically assigned a system label containing the name of the resource server that registered it, as well as a system label allowing users to add the resource to a list of favorites.
======

For information on creating system labels, see xref:#to-register-an-uma-resource-set["To Register an UMA Resource Set"].
--

Favourite Labels::
Each user can assign the builtin __star__ label to a resource to mark it as a favorite.
+
For more information, see xref:#to-apply-star-label-to-resource-set["To Mark a Resource as a Favorite"].

=== Managing UMA Policies

UMA authorization servers must manage the resource owner's authorization policies, so that registered resource sets can be protected.

OpenAM provides the `/json/users/{user}/uma/policies/` REST endpoint for creating and managing user-managed authorization policies.

Managing UMA policies requires that a resource set is registered to the user in the URL. For information on registering resource sets, see xref:#managing-uma-resource-sets["Managing UMA Resource Sets"].

Once a resource set is registered to the user, use the `/json/users/{user}/uma/policies/` REST endpoint for the following operations:

* xref:#to-create-an-uma-policy["To Create an UMA Policy"]

* xref:#to-read-an-uma-policy["To Read an UMA Policy"]

* xref:#to-update-an-uma-policy["To Update an UMA Policy"]

* xref:#to-query-uma-policies["To Query UMA Policies"]


[#to-create-an-uma-policy]
.To Create an UMA Policy
====
To create a policy, the resource owner must be logged in to the authorization server and have an SSO token issued to them, and must also know the xref:#to-register-an-uma-resource-set["To Register an UMA Resource Set"] to be protected. This information is used when creating policies.

[NOTE]
======
Only the resource owner can create a policy to protect a resource set. Administrator users such as `amadmin` cannot create policies on behalf of a resource owner.
======

* Create a POST request to the policies endpoint, including the SSO token in a header based on the configured session cookie name (default: `iPlanetDirectoryPro`), and the resource set ID as the value of `policyId` in the body.
+

[NOTE]
======
The SSO token must have been issued to the user specified in the URL. In this example, the user is `demo`.
======
+
The following example uses an SSO token to create a policy to share a resource set belonging to user __demo__ with two subjects, with different scopes for each:

[#to-query-uma-policies]
.To Query UMA Policies
====
To query policies, the resource owner or an administrator user must be logged in to the authorization server and have an SSO token issued to them. The xref:#to-create-an-uma-policy["To Create an UMA Policy"] to read must also be known.

* Create a GET request to the policies endpoint, including the SSO token in a header based on the configured session cookie name (default: `iPlanetDirectoryPro`).
+

[NOTE]
======
The SSO token must have been issued to the user specified in the URL, or to an administrative user such as `amadmin`.
In this example, the user is `demo`.
======
+
Use the following query string parameters to affect the returned results:
+


`_sortKeys=[+-]field[,field...]`::
Sort the results returned, where __field__ represents a field in the JSON policy objects returned.
+
For UMA policies, only the `policyId` and `name` fields can be sorted.
+
Optionally use the `+` prefix to sort in ascending order (the default), or `-` to sort in descending order.

`_pageSize=integer`::
Limit the number of results returned.

`_pagedResultsOffset=integer`::
Start the returned results from the specified index.

`_queryFilter`::
The _queryFilter parameter can take `true` to match every policy, `false` to match no policies, or a filter of the following form to match field values: `field operator value` where __field__ represents the field name, __operator__ is the operator code, __value__ is the value to match, and the entire filter is URL-encoded. Only the equals (`eq`) operator is supported by the `/uma/policies` endpoint.
+
--
The __field__ value can take the following values:

** `resourceServer` - the resource server that created the resource set.

** `permissions/subject` - the list of subjects that are assigned scopes in the policy.


Filters can be composed of multiple expressions by a using boolean operator `AND`, and by using parentheses, `(expression)`, to group expressions.

[NOTE]
========
You must URL-encode the filter expression in `_queryFilter=filter`. So, for example, the following filter:
`resourceServer eq "UMA-Resource-Server" AND permissions/subject eq "user.1"`
When URL-encoded becomes:
`resourceServer+eq+%22UMA-Resource-Server%22+AND+permissions%2Fsubject+eq+%22user.1%22`
========
The following example uses an SSO token to query the policies belonging to user __demo__, which have a subject `user.1` in the permissions:

[#accessing-uma-protected-resources]
=== Accessing UMA-Protected Resources

To access an UMA-protected resource, a client must provide the resource server with a Requesting Party Token (RPT) obtained from OpenAM, which is acting as the authorization server.

In order to obtain access to an UMA-protected resource, the following actions take place:

[#figure-uma-rpt-flow]
image::images/uma-rpt-flow.svg[]

* A requesting party, using a client application, requests access to an UMA-protected resource (labeled *1* in the diagram above).

* The resource server registers a permission request with OpenAM on behalf of the client (*2*), which contains the ID of the resource set to access, and the requested scopes. A permission ticket is returned (*3*), which the resource server provides to the client (*4*).
+
For more information about registering permission requests, see xref:#to-register-an-uma-permission-request["To Register an UMA Permission Request"].

* The client uses the permission ticket, and an Authorization API Token (AAT) to acquire an RPT from OpenAM (*5*).
+
For more information about acquiring an RPT, see xref:#uma-acquire-rpt["To Acquire a Requesting Party Token"].

* OpenAM makes a policy decision using the requested scopes, the scopes permitted in the registered resource set, and the user-created policy, and if successful returns an RPT (*6*).

* The client presents the RPT to the resource server (*7*) which must verify the token is valid using the OpenAM introspection endpoint (*8*).
+
For more information about the introspection endpoint, see xref:../dev-guide/chap-client-dev.adoc#rest-api-oauth2-client-endpoints["OAuth 2.0 Client and Resource Server Endpoints"] in the __Developer's Guide__.
+
If the RPT is confirmed to be valid, and non-expired (*9*) the resource server can return the protected resource to the requesting party (*10*).


[#to-register-an-uma-permission-request]
.To Register an UMA Permission Request
====
OpenAM provides the `/uma/permission_request` REST endpoint for a resource server to register an access request on behalf of a client.

To register a permission request, the resource server must first acquire a PAT token, as described in xref:#uma-acquire-pat["To Acquire a Protection API Token"].

Once you have the PAT bearer token, you can access the `/uma/permission_request` endpoint to register a permission request, as shown below:

* Create a POST request to the permission_request endpoint, including the PAT bearer token in a header named `Authorization`:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --request POST \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer 515d6551-6512-5279-98b6-c0ef3f03a723" \

     "scopes" : [
         "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/view",
         "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/all"
     ]
 }' \
 https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/uma/permission_request
 {
    "ticket": "dc630c21-7d55-45bf-958d-24d624441138"
 }
----
+
On success, an HTTP 201 Created status code is returned, as well as a `ticket` property in the JSON-formatted body, which can be used by the client to acquire a requesting party token. For more information, see xref:#uma-acquire-rpt["To Acquire a Requesting Party Token"].
+
If the resource set does not allow the requested scopes, an error is returned, as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
{
    "error_description": "Requested scopes are not in allowed scopes for resource set.",
    "error": "invalid_scope"
}
----

[#uma-acquire-aat]
.To Acquire an Authorization API Token
====
You must have first xref:chap-oauth2.adoc#register-oauth2-client["Registering OAuth 2.0 Clients With the Authorization Service"] with a name, such as __UMA-Client__ and a client password, such as __password__. Ensure that `uma_authorization` is in the list of available scopes in the client, and a redirection URI is configured:

. Direct the requesting party to the authorization server to obtain an AAT token. The URL should specify the client name registered above, the redirect URI, and request the `uma_authorization` scope, as shown in the example below:
+
`\https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/oauth2/authorize?client_id=UMA-Client&redirect_uri=http://openam.example.com:8080&response_type=code&scope=uma_authorization`
+
This example uses the OAuth 2.0 code grant, however the UMA client can use any of the OAuth 2.0 grants to obtain the access token.

. After logging in, the consent screen asks the requesting party to allow or deny the requested scopes.


[#figure-uma-client-auth-request]
image::images/uma-client-auth-request.png[]


. If the requesting party allows access, they are sent to the configured redirection URL, which will have a `code` query string parameter added, which is used to request the AAT.

. Create a POST request to the `/oauth2/access_token` endpoint, with the client credentials registered earlier, a grant type of `authorization_code`, a redirect URL, and the value of the `code` query string parameter returned in the previous step, as shown below:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --request POST \
 --data 'client_id=UMA-Client' \
 --data 'client_secret=password' \
 --data 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
 --data 'code=2b911969-5b8e-4d07-bf34-612917a37c9d' \
 --data 'redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fopenam.example.com%3A8080' \
 http://openam.example.com:8080/openam/oauth2/access_token

{
 "scope": "uma_authorization print",
 "expires_in": 599,
 "token_type": "Bearer",
 "refresh_token": "e77fac0e-0dc6-40c3-a600-3309451bd6ee",
 "access_token": "d47c2278-460b-41e8-bf98-a8a1206e2c58"
}
----
+
The value returned in `access_token` is the AAT bearer token, used in the following procedures.

====

[#uma-acquire-rpt]
.To Acquire a Requesting Party Token
====
OpenAM provides the `/uma/authz_request` REST endpoint for acquiring a Requesting Party Token (RPT).

The endpoint is protected - access requires a Authorization API Token (AAT) - an OAuth 2.0 token with a scope of `uma_authorization`. A client must acquire an AAT in order to use the authorization request endpoint. For more information, see xref:#uma-acquire-aat["To Acquire an Authorization API Token"].

Once the client has an AAT bearer token, it can access the `/uma/authz_request` endpoint to acquire an RPT, as shown below:

* Create a POST request to the authz_request endpoint, including the AAT bearer token in a header named `Authorization`, and the permission token in the JSON body of the request, as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --request POST \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer 3b08e99c-b09d-4a65-9780-ea0c9e1f0f52" \

 {
     "rpt": "162d6137-68a4-4e8e-950d-edd834589eb73"
 }
----
+
On success, an HTTP 201 Created status code is returned, as well as the `rpt` property in the JSON-formatted body.
+
If the resource owner has not shared the resource with the requesting party, an HTTP 403 Forbidden is returned. If OpenAM is configured to email the resource owner upon pending request creation as described in xref:../reference/chap-config-ref.adoc#uma-provider-configuration["UMA Provider"] in the __Reference__, the JSON body returned includes a message that the resource owner will be notified to allow or deny access to the resource, as shown below:
+

[source, console]
----
{
  "error": "request_submitted",
  "error_description": "The client is not authorised to access the requested resource set.
   A request has been submitted to the resource owner requesting access to the resource"
}

[#managing-pending-uma-requests]
==== Managing Pending UMA Permission Requests

OpenAM supports an UMA workflow in which a user can request access to a resource that has not been explicitly shared with them. The resource owner receives a notification of the request and can choose to allow or deny access.

[#to-view-pending-resource-access-requests]
.To View and Manage Pending Access Requests
====
Manage pending requests for access to resources by using the steps below:

. Login to OpenAM as the resource owner, and then navigate to Shares > Requests.

The Requests page is displayed:


[#uma-requests-page]
image::images/uma-pending-requests.png[]


. Review the pending request, and take one of the following actions:
+

* Click Allow to approve the request.
+

[TIP]
======
You can remove permissions from the request by clicking the permission, and then press either *Delete* or *Backspace*. Select the permission from the drop-down list to return it to the permissions granted to the resource owner.
======
+
The required UMA policy will be created, and optionally the requesting party will be notified that they can now access the resource.
+
The requesting party can view a list of resources to which they have access by navigating to Shares > Resources > Shared with me.

* Click Deny to prevent the requesting party from accessing the resource. The pending request is removed, and the requesting party will not be notified.
