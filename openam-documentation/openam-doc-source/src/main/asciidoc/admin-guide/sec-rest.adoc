[#sec-rest]
== Configuring REST APIs

You can configure the default behavior OpenAM will take when a REST call does not specify explicit version information using either of the following procedures:

* xref:#configure-versioning-ui["Configure Versioning Behavior by using the Web-based Console"]

* xref:#configure-versioning-ssoadm["Configure Versioning Behavior by using SSOADM"]

The available options for default behavior are as follows:
--

__Latest__::
The latest available supported version of the API is used.

+
This is the preset default for new installations of OpenAM.

__Oldest__::
The oldest available supported version of the API is used.

+
This is the preset default for upgraded OpenAM instances.

__None__::
No version will be used. When a REST client application calls a REST API without specifying the version, OpenAM returns an error and the request fails.
