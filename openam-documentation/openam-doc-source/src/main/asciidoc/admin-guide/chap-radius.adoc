[#chap-radius]
== Configuring OpenAM as a RADIUS Server

This chapter describes how to configure OpenAM as a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server that can accept authentication requests from RADIUS clients.

[#radius-protocol]
=== The RADIUS Protocol

RADIUS is a lightweight, datagram-based protocol formally specified in link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865[RFC 2865, window=\_blank] that is supported by many devices and servers for external authentication. VPN concentrators, routers, switches, wireless access points, and many other devices have native RADIUS support. Such devices are known as RADIUS clients. Using the RADIUS protocol, they converse with RADIUS servers to authenticate entities, such as users attempting to access their resources.

The RADIUS protocol itself is quite simple. There are four packet types:

* `Access-Request` packets are sent from a client to a server to begin a new authentication conversation, or to respond to a previous response in an existing conversation and provide requested information.

* `Access-Accept` packets are sent from a server to a client to indicate a successful authentication.

* `Access-Reject` packets are sent from a server to a client to indicate a failed authentication.

* `Access-Challenge` packets are sent from a server to a client to solicit more information from the entity being authenticated.

Each packet type defines:

* A set of fields that must be included

* Other fields that can be included to convey:
+

** Additional requirements

** Information about the context of the conversation

** Attributes of the entity after successful authentication

+

For example, an `Access-Request` packet should always contain user name and password fields, and it can contain other fields that provide information about the client making the request. For example, inclusion of the optional `State` field indicates that a packet is part of an authentication conversation already in progress. Its absence indicates the start of a new conversation.

An authentication conversation always begins with an `Access-Request` packet that does not have a `State` field. If the RADIUS server only requires the user name and password for authentication, then conversations will complete after the server sends an `Access-Accept` or `Access-Reject` packet, depending on whether the authentication credentials were valid. However, if more information is required by the server, such as an SMS-relayed one-time password sent to the user's phone, the additional requirement can be solicited using an `Access-Challenge` response to the client, followed by an `Access-Request` packet that has a `State` field that associates it with the existing conversation. The conversation completes with an `Access-Accept` or `Access-Reject` packet depending on whether the one-time password supplied in the second request matches the password sent to the user's phone.

This conversational style in which the server accepts, rejects, or solicits more information makes RADIUS an excellent match for leveraging OpenAM's authentication infrastructure. OpenAM performs authentication using chains of authentication modules found in realms. These modules identify authentication requirements that are conveyed to clients wishing to authenticate. The modules then accept values submitted by the user for verification. The mechanism for modules to convey these requirements to OpenAM is through a finite set of constructs known as callbacks. By leveraging OpenAM's flexible and extensible authentication mechanism, organizations can craft an authentication experience suitable for their needs, while using the same mechanisms for both HTTP and RADIUS authentication.


[#radius-support-in-openam]
=== RADIUS Support in OpenAM

Two OpenAM features support the RADIUS protocol: the RADIUS authentication module and the RADIUS Server service.

[#radius-support-auth-module]
==== RADIUS Authentication Module

The RADIUS authentication module enables OpenAM to act as a RADIUS client, delegating authentication to an external RADIUS server:

[#radius-support-auth-module-flow]
image::images/radius-auth-module-flow.svg[]
Use the RADIUS authentication module when you want OpenAM to pass user names and passwords through to an external RADIUS server so that the RADIUS server can authenticate the users.

For information about configuring the RADIUS authentication module, see xref:chap-auth-services.adoc#radius-module-conf-hints["Hints for the RADIUS Authentication Module"].


[#radius-support-radius-server-service]
==== RADIUS Server Service

The RADIUS Server service provides a RADIUS server within OpenAM. The server authenticates RADIUS clients that are external to OpenAM. The server is backed by OpenAM's authentication chains and modules, thereby providing the possibility of multi-factor authentication in addition to simple user name and password authentication.

The following example shows the flow of a successful simple user name and password authentication attempt from a RADIUS client:

[#radius-support-radius-server-simple-flow]
image::images/radius-server-flow-simple.svg[]
The following example shows the flow of a successful multi-factor authentication scenario in which the RADIUS Server service is backed by an authentication chain that includes the LDAP and the ForgeRock Authenticator (OATH) authentication modules. First, the LDAP authentication module requires the user to provide a user name and password. Then the ForgeRock Authenticator (OATH) module requires the user to enter a one-time password obtained from the authenticator app on a mobile phone:

[#radius-support-radius-server-multi-factor-flow]
image::images/radius-server-flow-multi-factor.svg[]
The rest of this chapter covers the configuration of the RADIUS Server service in an OpenAM deployment.



[#radius-server-configuration]
=== Configuring the RADIUS Server Service

The OpenAM RADIUS server is disabled by default. To enable it, perform the following steps:

[#radius-server-procedure-configure]
.To Enable and Configure the OpenAM RADIUS Server
====

. Login to the OpenAM console as the top-level administrative user, such as `amadmin`.

. Navigate to Configure > Global Services, and then click RADIUS Server.

. Under Secondary Configuration Instance, click New.
+
OpenAM uses secondary configuration instances in the RADIUS Server service to encapsulate RADIUS clients. You must configure one secondary configuration instance, also known as a subconfiguration, for each client that will connect to the RADIUS Server.

. Configure attributes for the subconfiguration. See xref:../reference/chap-config-ref.adoc#radius-server["RADIUS Server"] in the __Reference__ for information about configuring the subconfiguration attributes.

. Click Add to add the configuration for the RADIUS client to the overall RADIUS Server service's configuration.

. If you have multiple RADIUS clients that will connect to the OpenAM RADIUS server, add a subconfiguration for each client. It is not necessary to configure all your RADIUS clients when you configure the RADIUS Server service initiallyâ€”you can add and remove clients over time as you need them.

. Configure global attributes of the RADIUS Server service. At a minimum, set the Enabled field to `YES` to start the RADIUS server immediately after you save the RADIUS Server service configuration.
+
See xref:../reference/chap-config-ref.adoc#radius-server["RADIUS Server"] in the __Reference__ for information about configuring the RADIUS Server service's global attributes.

. On the main configuration page for the RADIUS Server service, click Save.

====
The RADIUS server starts immediately after you save the configuration if the Enabled field has the value `YES`. Any time you make changes to the RADIUS Server service configuration, they take effect as soon as you save the changes.


[#radius-troubleshooting]
=== Troubleshooting the RADIUS Server Service

This section covers how to configure OpenAM to troubleshoot the RADIUS Server service, describes how to run a sample client included with OpenAM, and provides details about some specific issues that you might run into when using the RADIUS Server service.

[#radius-troubleshooting-setup]
==== Configuring OpenAM for Troubleshooting the RADIUS Server Service

If you need to troubleshoot the RADIUS Server service, enable message-level debugging in OpenAM. For information about enabling OpenAM debug logging, see xref:chap-monitoring.adoc#debug-logging["Debug Logging"].

With message-level debug logging enabled, OpenAM writes messages to the `Radius` debug log file when notable events occur, including the following:

* RADIUS server startup

* Changes to the RADIUS server configuration

* Successful and unsuccessful client connections

* Various error events

You can also configure the RADIUS Server service to log the packets sent between RADIUS clients and OpenAM. To enable packet logging, use the Log Packet Contents for this Client property when configuring RADIUS clients in the RADIUS Server service.


[#radius-troubleshooting-client]
==== Running the Sample RADIUS Client

The `openam-radius-server-13.5.2-15.jar` includes a sample client that you can use to test simple connectivity to the RADIUS Server service.

The following procedure describes how to set up and run the sample client:

[#radius-troubleshooting-client-procedure]
.To Run the Sample RADIUS Client
====

. Configure the RADIUS Server service. Be sure to enable the service. Include a secondary configuration instance for the sample client as part of the service configuration.
+
For more information on the RADIUS Server service configuration properties, see xref:../reference/chap-config-ref.adoc#radius-server["RADIUS Server"] in the __Reference__.

. Create a file named `radius.properties` in the current working directory. The file consists of the following key-value pairs:
+

* `secret` - Mandatory property specifying the RADIUS client's shared secret. This property's value must be identical to the value of the Client Secret property for the RADIUS client in the OpenAM RADIUS Server service configuration.

* `host` - Mandatory property specifying the host name or IP address of the OpenAM server.

* `port` - Mandatory property specifying the port number on which OpenAM's RADIUS server listens. This property's value must be identical to the Listener Port property in the OpenAM RADIUS Server service configuration.

* `show-traffic` - Optional property specifying whether to show traffic packet during client operation. Valid values are `true` and `false`. Packet traffic is not shown if this property is not specified.

+
The following is an example `radius.properties` file:
+

[source, console]
----
secret=cangetin
host=openam.example.com
port=1812
show-traffic=true
----

. Make sure that your current working directory is the directory in which you created the `radius.properties` file, then execute the sample client. Messages from the sample client indicate success or failure authenticating. If you specify `show-traffic=true` in the `radius.properties` file, the packets to and from the OpenAM RADIUS server appear in standard output:
+

[source, console]
----
$ java -jar //path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib/openam-radius-server-13.5.2-15.jar
? Username: demo
? Password: changeit
Packet To openam.example.com:1812
  ACCESS_REQUEST [1]
    - USER_NAME : demo
    - USER_PASSWORD : *******
    - NAS_IP_ADDRESS : openam.example.com/192.168.10.10
    - NAS_PORT : 0

Packet From openam.example.com:1812
  ACCESS_ACCEPT [1]

---> SUCCESS! You've Authenticated!

[#radius-troubleshooting-issues]
==== Solutions to Common RADIUS Server Service Issues

This section offers solutions to issues that you might encounter when configuring communication between RADIUS clients and the RADIUS Server service. The solutions assume that you have enabled message-level debugging for the RADIUS Server service in OpenAM and have access to the debug logs.
--

Client Cannot Connect::
When a RADIUS client connects to OpenAM's RADIUS server and hangs without receiving a response, the problem could be one of four possible issues:
+

* The OpenAM RADIUS Server service is not enabled.
+
An entry similar to the following in the `Radius` debug log indicates that OpenAM's RADIUS Server was started:
+

[source, console]
----
amRadiusServer:10/12/2015 12:00:14:814 PM PDT: Thread[RADIUS-1812-Listener,5,main]:
TransactionId[27350419-8c21-429e-b580-35abf64604cf]
RADIUS Listener is Active.
Port              : 1812
Threads Core      : 2
Threads Max       : 10
Thread Keep-alive : 10 sec
Request Queue     : 10
----
+
If no such entry exists in the debug log, re-examine the configuration for the RADIUS Server service and correct the problem.

* The client is not defined.
+
An entry similar to the following in the `Radius` debug log indicates the inability of a client to connect:
+

[source, console]
----
amRadiusServer:10/12/2015 04:05:53:681 PM PDT: Thread[RADIUS-1812-Listener,5,main]:
TransactionId[270084d5-b7d0-42e4-8709-eeaeaf435aff]
WARNING: No Defined RADIUS Client matches IP address /192.168.10.10. Dropping request.
----
+
To fix the problem, correct the client configuration in the RADIUS Server service.

* The handler class for the client is incorrect.
+
An entry similar to the following in the `Radius` debug log indicates an incorrect handler class:
+

[source, console]
----
ERROR: Configuration setting handlerClass in RADIUS Client configuration named
'TestClient' is invalid. Requests from this client will be ignored.
----
+
To fix the problem, correct the client configuration in the RADIUS Server service.

* Traffic is not arriving at the OpenAM server.
+
No specific debug log entries appear for this problem.
+
This is likely a network communication problem. Investigate the route for traffic between the RADIUS client and the OpenAM RADIUS server to see where communication is lost.

+

Authentication Always Fails::
When authentication always fails, the probable cause is one of the following three issues:
+

* The client secret configured for the client in the RADIUS Server service is incorrect.
+
In an `Access-Request` packet, the shared secret is used along with the random value sent in the request authenticator field to encrypt the password field value that is passed across the wire. If the client and server's shared secrets are not identical, the password expected by the server will not match the password sent by the client, resulting in authentication always failing. The user's password is always incorrect in such a scenario and there is no way for the server to differentiate between the client secret being incorrect and the password sent from the client being incorrect. The log file indicates that OpenAM has sent an `Access-Reject` packet to the client, similar to the action that would be taken if the shared secret matched on the client and server and the user entered an invalid password:
+

[source, console]
----
amRadiusServer:10/12/2015 04:27:55:785 PM PDT: Thread[RADIUS-1812-Listener,5,main]:
TransactionId[270084d5-b7d0-42e4-8709-eeaeaf435aff]
finalPacketType sent in response to auth request: 'ACCESS_REJECT'
----
+
Since the shared secret is specific to each client, such messages might appear for one RADIUS client, while other clients can authenticate successfully.
+
To fix this problem, correct the configuration for your client in the RADIUS Server service.

* The realm configured for the client in the RADIUS Server service is incorrect.
+
An entry similar to the following in the `Radius` debug log indicates an invalid realm in the RADIUS Server service configuration:
+

[source, console]
----
ERROR: Unable to start login process. Denying Access.
com.sun.identity.authentication.spi.AuthLoginException: Domain is invalid|
invalid_domain.jsp
----
+
If the realm is missing from the configuration, an error similar to the following appears:
+

[source, console]
----
ERROR: Unable to initialize declared handler class
'org.forgerock.openam.radius.server.spi.handlers.OpenAMAuthHandler' for RADIUS
client ''. Rejecting access.
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Configuration property 'realm' not found in
handler configuration. It must be added to the Configuration Properties for this
class in the Radius Client's configuration.
----
+
To fix this problem, correct the client configuration in the RADIUS Server service.

* The authentication chain configured for the client in the RADIUS Server service is incorrect.
+
An entry similar to the following in the `Radius` debug log indicates an invalid authentication chain in the RADIUS Server service configuration:
+

[source, console]
----
amRadiusServer:10/12/2015 05:32:21:771 PM PDT: Thread[pool-5-thread-2,5,main]:
TransactionId[378a41cf-0581-4b62-a92f-be2b008ab4d3] ERROR: Unable to start login
process. Denying Access.
----
+
If the chain is missing from the configuration, an error similar to the following appears:
+

[source, console]
----
ERROR: Unable to initialize declared handler class
'org.forgerock.openam.radius.server.spi.handlers.OpenAMAuthHandler' for RADIUS
client ''. Rejecting access.
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Configuration property 'chain' not found in
handler configuration. It must be added to the Configuration Properties for this
class in the Radius Client's configuration.
----
+
To fix this problem, correct the client configuration in the RADIUS Server service.

+

Configuration Is Correct but Authentication Fails::
In this case, you might have a client-specific problem. OpenAM provides a tool that you can use to eliminate OpenAM and its configuration as the cause of the problem. You can declare an alternate handler class implementation in the RADIUS Server service configuration. Two test handlers are available for troubleshooting purposes:
+

* The `org.forgerock.openam.radius.server.spi.handlers.AcceptAllHandler` handler always returns an `Access-Accept` packet, indicating successful authentication for all requests.

* The `org.forgerock.openam.radius.server.spi.handlers.RejectAllHandler` handler always returns an `Access-Reject` packet, indicating failed authentication for all requests.

+
In a case where you believe that configuration is correct but authentication always fails, you could specify the `org.forgerock.openam.radius.server.spi.handlers.AcceptAllHandler` handler class in the RADIUS Server service configuration for your client. With packet logging enabled, all requests received from the client should log packet contents traffic similar to the following even if the password is incorrect:
+

[source, console]
----
WARNING:
Packet from TestClient:
  ACCESS_REQUEST [1]
    - USER_NAME : demo
    - USER_PASSWORD : *******
    - NAS_IP_ADDRESS : /127.0.0.1
    - NAS_PORT : 0
----
+
+
This is followed by:
+

[source, console]
----
WARNING:
Packet to TestClient:
  ACCESS_ACCEPT [1]
----
+
+
If the client still indicates that authentication has failed, refer to the documentation for the client to determine why the `Access-Accept` response is rejected. Most likely, the client expects specific fields in the `Access-Accept` response that are not provided by OpenAM. There is currently no facility in OpenAM to return fields in `Access-Accept` responses.

Authentication Always Succeeds, Even With a Bad Password::
This would be a very unusual situation, probably due to the `org.forgerock.openam.radius.server.spi.handlers.AcceptAllHandler` handler being left in place after troubleshooting an error scenario in which authentication always suceeds.

+
To resolve the problem, verify that the correct handler class is specified in the RADIUS Server service configuration for the client. If it is not specified, review the authentication modules in the chain that authenticates users and determine whether one of the modules might be accepting all authentication requests. This situation could also occur because of incorrectly-specified module criteria in the chain's definition.

[#radius-limitations]
=== RADIUS Server Limitations

Deploying OpenAM's RADIUS server lets an organization consolidate RADIUS and HTTP authentication into a single solution, facilitating reuse of existing authentication mechanisms between both types of clients. However, there are several limitations:

* Because RADIUS authentication attempts always start with a user name and password transmitted in an `Access-Request` packet, the first module in an authentication chain used for RADIUS clients must accept a user name and a password.

* Some OpenAM callback types are not applicable to RADIUS clients. For example, a `RedirectCallback` directs HTTP clients, such as browsers, to HTTP resources to be used for some aspect of authentication. Redirects make no sense to RADIUS clients and cannot be consumed in any meaningful way.
+
A `ConfirmationCallback` also presents challenges for RADIUS clients.
+
As a result, some OpenAM authentication modules cannot be used with RADIUS clients. Before attempting to use an authentication module with RADIUS clients, review the module's callbacks to determine whether the module will support RADIUS clients. You can use the REST API to determine the callbacks for an authentication module as described in xref:../dev-guide/chap-client-dev.adoc#rest-api-auth["Authentication and Logout"] in the __Developer's Guide__.

* Some client mechanisms leveraged by authentication modules might not be applicable to RADIUS clients. For example, suppose a customized SMS one-time password module sends a one-time password over an SMS service, and then provides a `ChoiceCallback` that enables the user to set a cookie in their browser that expires after 30 days. Such a module might first determine whether the cookie was available, still valid, and applicable to the current user before reissuing a new one-time and soliciting the value from the user.
+
RADIUS clients are unable to process HTTP cookies. Therefore, although RADIUS clients can support a `ChoiceCallback`, the customized feature described in the previous paragraph would not function correctly for RADIUS clients and therefore should not be deployed with RADIUS clients. As a result, some callback sets within an authentication module will differ depending on the type of client being authenticated.

* The RADIUS Server service logs __only__ to the ForgeRock common audit logger introduced in OpenAM 13. It does __not__ log to the classic OpenAM audit logs that were available prior to OpenAM 13.

When building custom authentication modules, consider their suitability to handle the types of clients that might use them, and make adjustments to callbacks as needed.
