[#chap-cts-oids]
== Core Token Service (CTS) Object Identifiers

The OIDs related to SNMP monitoring of CTS follow guidance described in link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1271[RFC 1271, window=\_blank].

The OIDs listed in this section include the prefix assigned to ForgeRock, `enterprises.36733`. They also include the entries associated with OpenAM (1), SNMP (2), and CTS monitoring (3): `1.2.3`.

Therefore, the root OID for all CTS monitored components is `enterprises.36733.1.2.3`. All individual monitored CTS components are suffixes that are consistent with the image shown here.

[#oid-token-types]
=== CTS Token Type OIDs

The table below shows how OIDs are split into different token types. Do not forget the prefix. For example, the complete OID for monitoring SAML v2.0 tokens is `enterprises.36733.1.2.3.1.1.2`

The options for the token table are shown in the following table. For example, the token table OID for SAML v2.0 is based on the entries associated with ForgeRock, `enterprises.36733`, OpenAM `1`, SNMP `2`, CTS Monitoring `3`, token table `1`, entry `1`, and SAML v2.0 `2`, which is `enterprises.36733.1.2.3.1.1.2`.

[#cts-monitoring-oid-operation-type]
=== CTS Monitoring Operation Types

OIDs related to CTS monitoring operations are based on basic CRUD operations (plus list).

The options for the operation table are shown in the following table.

[#cts-monitoring-oid-op-type]

[#cts-monitoring-oid-data-types]
=== CTS Monitoring Entry Data Types

CTS monitoring entries use the following data types:
--

`Counter64`::
A 64-bit, unsigned integer type.

+
`Counter64` is a standard data type returned by SNMP OIDs. For more information, see link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2578#section-7.1.10[Structure of Management Information Version 2, window=\_top].

`Float2dp`::
A floating point number with the value link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2579#section-3.1[d-2, window=\_top] in the `DISPLAY-HINT` clause. SNMP clients that handle the `DISPLAY-HINT` clause will correctly display the value as a floating point number with two decimal places. Other types of clients that do not handle the `DISPLAY-HINT` clause will incorrectly display the value as an integer that is one hundred times larger than the correct value.

+
`Float2dp` is a custom data type returned by some ForgeRock CTS OIDs.

[#cts-monitoring-oid-operation-count]
=== CTS CRUD Operation Entries

The OIDs in this table relate to all CRUD (and list) operations.

The options for the CRUD operations table are shown in the following tables. Each value is associated with CRUD and list operations.

[#cts-monitoring-oid-operation-token-type]
=== CTS CRUD Operations Per Token Type

OIDs that start with `enterprises.36733.1.2.3.4.1` are labels for CTS CRUD operations per token type.

Tokens of each type can be created, read, updated, deleted, and listed. Each of these types can be measured cumulatively. They can also be measured over a period of time (default=10 seconds), as an average, minimum, and maximum.

OID suffixes for CRUD operations are defined according to the following rules.

The first part of the OID is `enterprises.36733.1.2.3.4.1`.

The next OID suffix specifies a metric:

[#cts-reaper-oids]
=== CTS Reaper Run Information

The CTS reaper deletes unused or expired tokens. Unless OpenAM is in a shutdown cycle, the CTS reaper is designed to run continuously. By default, the CTS reaper runs in fixed intervals, unless OpenAM is in the process of shutting down.

A single OID, `enterprises.36733.1.2.3.6.0`, relates to the CTS reaper. This OID:

* Specifies the average rate of deleted tokens per CTS reaper run

* Has the link:#cts-monitoring-oid-data-types[Float2dpdata type].



[#cts-conn-factory-oids]
=== CTS Connection Factory OIDs

Every request for a CTS token is a request to the `CTSConnectionFactory`. Such requests can either succeed or fail. The following OIDs provide measures for both such connections. The CTSConnectionFactory OIDs are also measured using a rate window system, similar to all the other CTS OIDs, except the CTS Reaper.

As there are no indexes required to look up the value of CTSConnectionFactory OIDs, they end in 0. Success or failure of these OIDs are not specific to any operation or token type.

The following tables list the OIDs related to the CTSConnectionFactory.
