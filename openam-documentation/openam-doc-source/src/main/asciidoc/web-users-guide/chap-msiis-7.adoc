[#chap-msiis-7]
== Installing Web Policy Agents in Microsoft IIS

This chapter covers prerequisites and installation procedures for Web Policy Agents 4 into Microsoft Internet Information Services (__IIS__) 7 and 8.

[#before-iis-agent-install]
=== Before You Install

This section describes the prerequisite steps you should take before installing the web policy agents into IIS servers.

* Ensure OpenAM is installed and running, so that you can contact OpenAM from the system running the policy agent.

* Create a profile for your policy agent as described in link:../web-users-guide/index.html#chap-web-agents[Configuring Web Policy Agent Profiles].

* Create at least one policy in OpenAM to protect resources with the agent, as described in the section on link:../../../docs/openam/13/admin-guide/#configure-authz-policy[Configuring Policies, window=\_blank]. Consider creating a simple policy, such as a policy that allows only authenticated users to access your resources. This allows you to test your policy agent after installation.

* If the OpenAM server you will be connecting to uses SSL, you must install OpenSSL on the agent machine.
+
Ensure the OpenSSL libraries `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` are available in the `lib` folder of your agent installation, for example `c:\path\to\web_agents\iis_agent\lib\`.

* Web policy agents require that the __Application Development__ component is installed alongside the core IIS services. Application Development is an optional component of the IIS web server. The component provides required infrastructure for hosting web applications.

image::images/iis-application-development-role.png[]


* See the OpenAM __Installation Guide__ section, link:../../../docs/openam/13/install-guide/#download-openam-software[Obtaining OpenAM Software, window=\_blank] to determine which version of the agent to download, and download the agent. Also, verify the checksum of the file you download against the checksum posted on the download page.
+
Unzip the file in the directory where you plan to install the web policy agent. The agent you install stores its configuration and logs under this directory.
+
When you unzip the policy agent `.zip` download, you find the following directories:
+
--

`bin`::
The installation and configuration program `agentadmin`.

`config`::
Configuration templates used by the `agentadmin` command during installation.

`instances`::
Configuration files, and audit and debug logs for individual instances of the web policy agents will be created here. The folder is empty when first extracted.

`legal`::
Contains licensing information including third-party licenses.

`lib`::
Shared libraries used by the policy agent.

`log`::
Location for log files written during installation. The folder is empty when first extracted.

--



[#install-iis-web-agent]
=== Installing IIS Web Policy Agents

Complete the following procedures to install Web Policy Agents 4 into Apache HTTP Servers.

[TIP]
====
Check that you have completed the prerequisite steps before proceeding. See xref:#before-iis-agent-install[Before You Install].
====

[#d183e5498]
.To Create the Agent Profile
====
Regardless of whether you store configurations centrally in OpenAM or locally with your agents, the agent requires a profile so that it can connect to and communicate with OpenAM.

. In the OpenAM console, browse to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Web, and then click the New... button in the Agent table.

. Complete the web form using the following hints.
+
--

Name::
The name for the agent profile used when you install the agent

Password::
Password the agent uses to authenticate to OpenAM

Configuration::
Centralized configurations are stored in the OpenAM configuration store. You can manage the centralized configuration through the OpenAM console. Local configurations are stored in a file alongside the agent.

Server URL::
The full URL to an OpenAM instance, or if OpenAM is deployed in a site configuration (behind a load balancer) then the site URL
+
In centralized configuration mode, the Server URL is used to populate the agent profile for services, such as Login, Logout, Naming, and Cross Domain SSO.

Agent URL::
The URL to the web agent application, such as `\http://www.example.com:80`
+
In centralized configuration mode, the Agent URL is used to populate the Agent Profile for services, such as notifications.

--

====

[#d183e5555]
.To Create a Password File
====

. Create a text file containing only the password specified when creating the agent profile.
+
UNIX example:
+

[source, console]
----
$ echo password > /tmp/pwd.txt

[#iis-enable-basic-auth]
=== Enable IIS Basic Authentication and Password Replay Support

The IIS web policy agent now supports IIS basic authentication and password replay. You must use the appropriate software versions.

Given the proper configuration and with Active Directory as a user data store for OpenAM, the IIS web policy agent can provide access to the IIS server variables. The instructions for configuring the capability follow in this section, though you should read the section in full, also paying attention to the required workarounds for Microsoft issues.

When configured as described, the policy agent requests IIS server variable values from OpenAM, which gets them from Active Directory. The policy agent then sets the values in HTTP headers so that they can be accessed by your application.

The following IIS server variables all take the same value when set: `REMOTE_USER`, `AUTH_USER`, and `LOGON_USER`. The policy agent either sets all three, or does not set any of them.

When you enable Logon and Impersonation in the console (`com.sun.identity.agents.config.iis.logonuser=true` in the policy agent configuration), the policy agent performs Windows logon and sets the user impersonation token in the IIS session context.

When you enable Show Password in HTTP Header in the console (`com.sun.identity.agents.config.iis.password.header=true` in the policy agent configuration), the policy agent adds it in the `USER_PASSWORD` header.

The policy agent does not modify any other IIS server variables related to the authenticated user's session.

The policy agent works best with IIS running in Integrated, not Classic mode. In Classic mode, you cannot share sessions between the policy agent and another .NET application, so Logon and Impersonation are not operative. Furthermore IIS in Classic mode treats all modules as ISAPI extensions, and request processing is affected. It is therefore strongly recommended that you run IIS in Integrated mode:

* For Microsoft Office integration, you must use Microsoft Office 2007 SP2 or later.

* For Microsoft SharePoint integration, you must use Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007 SP2 or later.

You must also apply workarounds as described for the following Microsoft issues.

[#configure-iis-basic-auth]
.To Configure IIS Basic Authentication and Password Replay Support
====
Follow these steps:

. Generate and store an encryption key:
+

.. Generate the key using `com.sun.identity.common.DESGenKey` using the .jars where you deployed OpenAM, as in the following example. The Java command below is broken out into multiple lines for display purposes only:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /tomcat/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib
$ java -cp forgerock-util-3.0.0.jar:openam-core-13.jar:\
   openam-shared-13.jar com.sun.identity.common.DESGenKey
Key ==> sxVoaDRAN0o=
----
+
Windows users should use semi-colons (";"), instead of colons (":") in the commands. The Java command below is broken out into multiple lines for display purposes only:
+

[source, console]
----
c:\> cd \tomcat\webapps\openam\WEB-INF\lib
c:\> java -cp forgerock-util-3.0.0.jar;openam-core-13.jar; ^
    openam-shared-13.jar com.sun.identity.common.DESGenKey
Key ==> sxVoaDRAN0o=
----

.. In the OpenAM console navigate to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Web > __Agent Name__ > Advanced > Microsoft IIS Server > Replay Password Key (property name: `com.sun.identity.agents.config.replaypasswd.key`), enter the generated key, and then click Save.

.. In the OpenAM console, navigate to Configuration > Servers and Sites > __Server Name__ > Advanced > Add..., then add a property `com.sun.am.replaypasswd.key` with the key you generated as the value, and then click Save.


. In the OpenAM console, navigate to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Authentication > Settings > Post Authentication Processing > Authentication Post Processing Classes, then add the class `com.sun.identity.authentication.spi.ReplayPasswd`, and then click Save.

. If you require Windows logon, or you need to use basic authentication with SharePoint or OWA, then you must configure Active Directory as a user data store, and you must configure the IIS policy agent profile User ID Parameter and User ID Parameter Type so that the policy agent requests OpenAM to provide the appropriate account information from Active Directory in its policy response.
+
Skip this step if you do not use SharePoint or OWA and no Windows logon is required.
+
Make sure OpenAM data store is configured to use Active Directory as the user data store.
+
In the OpenAM console under Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Web > __Agent Name__ > OpenAM Services > Policy Client Service, set User ID Parameter and User ID Parameter Type, and then save your work. For example if the real username for Windows domain logon in Active Directory is stored on the `sAMAccountName` attribute, then set the User ID Parameter to `sAMAccountName`, and the User ID Parameter Type to `LDAP`.
+
Setting the User ID Parameter Type to `LDAP` causes the policy agent to request that OpenAM get the value of the User ID Parameter attribute from the data store, in this case, Active Directory. Given that information, the policy agent can set the HTTP headers `REMOTE_USER`, `AUTH_USER`, or `LOGON_USER` and `USER_PASSWORD` with Active Directory attribute values suitable for Windows logon, setting the remote user, and so forth.

. To set the encrypted password in the `AUTH_PASSWORD` header, browse in the OpenAM console to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Web > __Agent Name__ > Advanced > Microsoft IIS Server, then select Show Password in HTTP Header, and then click Save.

. To have the agent perform Windows logon (for user token impersonation), browse in the OpenAM console to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Web > __Agent Name__ > Advanced > Microsoft IIS Server, then select Logon and Impersonation, and then click Save.

. In the OpenAM console, navigate to Realms > __Realm Name__ > Agents > Web > __Agent Name__ > Advanced > Microsoft IIS Server, then set Authentication Type to `basic`, and then click Save.

. (Optional)  To access Microsoft Office from SharePoint pages, configure OpenAM to persist the authentication cookie. For details, see "link:../../../docs/openam/13/admin-guide/#persistent-cookie[Hints for the Persistent Cookie Module, window=\_blank]" in the __OpenAM Administration Guide__.
