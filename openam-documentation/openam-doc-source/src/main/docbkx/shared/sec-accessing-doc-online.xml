 <title>Accessing OpenAM Documentation Online</title>

 <para>Core documentation, such as what you are now reading, aims to
 be technically accurate and complete with respect to the software
 documented. Core documentation therefore follows a <link xlink:show="new"
 xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/devcom/Review+Process'
 >three-phase review process</link> designed to eliminate errors. The
 review process should slow authors down enough that documentation you get
 with a stable release has had time to bake fully.</para>

 <para>Fully baked core documentation is available at <link
 xlink:href='http://docs.forgerock.org/'>docs.forgerock.org</link>.</para>

 <para>The <link
 xlink:href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/OPENAM/Home"
 xlink:show="new">OpenAM Wiki</link> regularly brings you more, fresh content.
 In addition, you are welcome to <link xlink:show="new"
 xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
 >sign up</link> and then edit the Wiki if you notice an error, or if you
 have something to share.</para>
