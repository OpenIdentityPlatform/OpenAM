 <para>This chapter covers setting up session failover (SFO) when using multiple
 instances of OpenAM in a site configuration for high availability. The basic
 idea followed here is that you configure load balancing to be sticky, based
 on the value of an OpenAM cookie, <literal>amlbcookie</literal>, different
 for each OpenAM server. Should that server become unavailable, the load
 balancer fails client requests over to another OpenAM server. The other OpenAM
 server must then fail over the user session associated with the client.</para>
 
 <para>SFO uses a highly available data store for OpenAM
 session data, shared by OpenAM servers in a site configuration. When the
 OpenAM server where a user authenticated goes down, other OpenAM servers can
 read the user session information from the highly available store, so the
 user does not have to authenticate again. When the original OpenAM server
 becomes available again, it can also read session information from the
 store, and carry on serving users with active sessions.</para>

     Configuring an Additional Instance</citetitle></link>
     provides the steps to configure each instance of OpenAM.
     The following procedure describes how to configure an OpenAM
     server to use a load balancer for the first instance if it was not
     part of the initial configuration.</para>

 <note>
  <para>Following an upgrade to OpenAM 10.1.0 XPress release, all users will
  need to login again because OpenAM no longer uses Open Message Queue or 
  Berkeley DB Java Edition for SFO. </para>
 </note>
 
 <note>
  <para>SFO is supported within a site or data center with a
  shared local area network. SFO is not supported across sites
  and data centers linked by wide area networks (WAN).</para>
 </note>
 
  <procedure xml:id="first-instance-load-balancer">
  <title>Configure First OpenAM Instance Behind a Load Balancer</title>
  
  <para>Before you set up SFO, first configure OpenAM in a site
  configuration with a load balancer as the entry point to the site. The most 
  expedient way to configure the site is to set it up during the initial OpenAM
  configuration, where OpenAM can manage and replicate server configuration for 
  availability. However, you may already have a working instance before realizing that 
  multiple instances are necessary. The following steps walk you through setting
  up the load balancer for the first instance.</para>
  
  <step>
   <para>In the OpenAM console for the first instance of the site, select
   <literal> Configuration &gt; Servers and Sites</literal> and click on
   the first server under <literal>Servers</literal>.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Under site <literal>Site</literal> click on <literal>Parent 
   Site</literal> and select the load balancer.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Click on <literal>Save</literal>.</para>
  </step>
 </procedure>

 <procedure xml:id="before-you-start-site-failover">
  <title>Setting a Load Balancer on Existing Configurations</title>
  
  <para>If you did not set up the site during initial configuration,
  then follow all the steps below.</para>
  
  <step>
   <para>In the OpenAM console for one of the servers in the site, select
   Configuration &gt; Servers and Sites &gt; Sites &gt; New..., and then
   create a new site.</para>
   <para>The site URL is the URL to the load balancer in front of your OpenAM
   servers in the site. For example, if your load balancer listens on host
   <literal>lb.example.com</literal> and port <literal>8080</literal>,
   with OpenAM under <literal>/openam</literal>, then your site URL is
   <literal>http://lb.example.com:8080/openam</literal>.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>For each OpenAM server in the site, select Configuration &gt;
   Servers and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; <replaceable>Server Name</replaceable>,
   and then set Parent Site to the site you created before saving your
   work.</para>
  </step>
  <step performance="optional">
   <para>If you want to use sticky load balancing, configure your load balancer
   to inspect the value of the <literal>amlbcookie</literal> to determine which
   OpenAM server should receive the client request.</para>
   <para>As your load balancer depends on the <literal>amlbcookie</literal>
   value, on each OpenAM server console in the site, select Configuration &gt;
   Servers and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; <replaceable>Server Name</replaceable>
   &gt; Advanced, makes sure that
   <literal>com.iplanet.am.lbcookie.value</literal> is unique. By default
   the value of the <literal>amlbcookie</literal> is set to the server ID
   for the OpenAM instance.</para>
   <note>
    <para>When using SSL, the approach requires that you either terminate SSL
    on the load balancer, or that you re-encrypt traffic from the load balancer
    to the OpenAM servers.</para>
   </note>
   <para>If you must change <literal>amlbcookie</literal> values to make them
   unique, then your changes take effect after you restart the OpenAM server.
   (To check, login to the console and check the cookie value in your
   browser.)</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Restart each OpenAM server or the web containers where the OpenAM
   servers run so that all configuration changes take effect.</para>
