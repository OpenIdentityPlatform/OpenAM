  <title>Solutions to Common Issues</title>

   <para>This section offers solutions to common problems when installing 
   OpenAM policy agents.</para>
  
  <qandaentry xml:id="cannot-install-over-https">
   <question>
    <para>I am trying to install a policy agent, connecting to OpenAM over
    HTTPS, and seeing the following error.</para>

    <screen>OpenAM server URL: https://openam.example.com:8443/openam

WARNING: Unable to connect to OpenAM server URL. Please specify the
correct OpenAM server URL by hitting the Back button (&lt;) or if the OpenAM
server URL is not started and you want to start it later, please proceed with
the installation.
If OpenAM server is SSL enabled and the root CA certificate for the OpenAM
server certificate has been not imported into installer JVMs key store (see
installer-logs/debug/Agent.log for detailed exception), import the root
CA certificate and restart the installer; or continue installation without
verifying OpenAM server URL.</screen>

    <para>What should I do?</para>
   </question>

   <answer>
    <para>The Java platform includes certificates from many Certificate
    Authorities (CAs). If however you run your own CA, or you use self-signed
    certificates for HTTPS on the container where you run OpenAM, then the
    <command>agentadmin</command> command cannot trust the certificate
    presented during connection to OpenAM, and so cannot complete installation
    correctly.</para>

    <para>After setting up the container where you run OpenAM to use HTTPS,
    get the certificate to trust in a certificate file. The certificate you
    want is the that of the CA who signed the container certificate, or the
    certificate itself if the container certificate is self-signed.</para>

    <para>Copy the certificate file to the system where you plan to install the
    policy agent. Import the certificate into a trust store that you will use
    during policy agent installation. If you import the certificate into the
    default trust store for the Java platform, then the
    <command>agentadmin</command> command can recognize it without additional
    configuration.</para>

    <para>Export and import of self-signed certificates is demonstrated in the
    <citetitle>Administration Guide</citetitle> chapter on <link
    xlink:show="new" xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-certs-keystores"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Managing
    Certificates</citetitle></link>.</para>
   </answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry xml:id="debug-file-and-SELinux">
   <question>
    <para>I am trying to install the policy agent on SELinux and I am getting error messages
  after installation. What happened?</para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>SELinux must be properly configured to connect the web policy agent and OpenAM
  nodes. Either re-configure SELinux or disable it, then reinstall the policy agent.</para>
   </answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry xml:id="apache-defaults-to-port-80">
   <question>
    <para>My Apache HTTPD server is not using port 80. But when I install the
    web policy agent it defaults to port 80. How do I fix this?</para>
   </question>

   <answer>
    <para>You probably set <literal>ServerName</literal> in Apache HTTPD's
    configuration to the host name, but did not specify the port number.</para>

    <para>Instead you must set both the host name and port number for
    <literal>ServerName</literal> in Apache HTTPD's configuration. For
    example, if you have Apache HTTPD configured to listen on port 8080, then
    set <literal>ServerName</literal> appropriately as in the following
    excerpt.</para>

    <programlisting language="plain"
    >&lt;VirtualHost *:8080&gt;
ServerName www.localhost.example:8080</programlisting>
   </answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry xml:id="web-agent-cannot-rotate-logs">
   <question>
    <para>My web server and web policy agent are installed as root, and the
    agent cannot rotate logs. I am seeing this error.</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced">Could not rotate log file ... (error: 13)</literallayout>

    <para>What should I do?</para>
   </question>

   <answer>
    <para>First, avoid installing the web server (and therefore also the web
    policy agent) as root, but instead create a web server user and install
    as that user.</para>

    <para>If however you cannot avoid installing the web server and policy agent
    as root, the you must give all users read and write permissions to the
    <filename>logs/</filename> and <filename>logs/debug</filename> directories
    under the agent instance directory (
    <filename>/path/to/web_agents/<replaceable>type</replaceable>/Agent_<replaceable>number</replaceable>/logs/</filename>).
    Otherwise the web policy agent fails to rotate log files with the error
    you observed.</para>
