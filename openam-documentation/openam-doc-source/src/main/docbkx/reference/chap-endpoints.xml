 <title>Service Endpoints</title>


    <indexterm><primary>Endpoints</primary></indexterm>
    <para>A service endpoint is a URL which serves as the access port for a web service. It may be a standard HTML-based
        web page, or it may be a *.jsp page.</para>

<!--
     I'd define an endpoint as the entry point to a web service.
     Endpoint seems to be a term in web services, http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/xml/ws/Endpoint.html
     If there's a better word for these, let's use it.
     More info: http://www.scribd.com/doc/17599432/Designing-Web-Services-With-the-J2EE-14-Platform-JAXRPC-SOAP-And-XML-Technologies

     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9807382/what-is-a-web-service-endpoint
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/erl-wsdl-087381.html
 -->
    
    
        <para>As every service endpoint is a potential security issue, it may be appropriate to
        restrict access to some of those endpoints that you do not use. But be careful.
        Some endpoints, such as <literal>isAlive.jsp</literal> in the main /path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam directory, are
        essential and should not be blocked or changed.</para>

        <para>Given the large number
        of available endpoints, this chapter has been organized primarily by subdirectory.
        Most of the directories were created when the OpenAM war archive was copied to the appropriate web application
        container, such as the webapps/ subdirectory. </para>
        
<!--
     Is there a webapps/ subdirectory in all the containers we support?
     Where these things end up on the file system probably depends on the container.
     mj - made language more generic
 -->

<!-- You only need to define the indexterm at most once per section. mj - second indexterm deleted -->

 <para>OpenAM may expose several hundred service endpoints, listed in this chapter.
 Each endpoint shown is listed relative to the deployment URL.
 For example, if you have deployed OpenAM at <literal>https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/</literal>,
 the full URL to the <literal>isAlive.jsp</literal> endpoint is
 <literal>https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/isAlive.jsp</literal>.</para>

 <para>OpenAM includes two types of endpoints. One is based on URL patterns, shown with the <literal>url-pattern</literal>
     tag. You can find these patterns in the web.xml file, in the /path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/WEB-INF directory.
     The other type is based on *.jsp pages, starting in the main /path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam directory, and also
     in many associated subdirectories. If you copied or created a WAR archive to a name other than <literal>openam.war</literal>,
     as described in the installation guide, substitute for the second <literal>openam</literal> accordingly.</para>

    <para>Some of these endpoints can be applied directly to a URL when you've connected to the OpenAM server;
        for example, if you've configured OpenAM on <literal>http://idp.example.com:8080/openam</literal>, you
    can log in and review debug options by navigating to <literal>http://idp.example.com:8080/openam/Debug.jsp
        </literal></para>

    <para>Other endpoints can only be used when called by some option in the OpenAM console. For example, while the
    AgentAdd.jsp endpoint exists in the console/agentconfig subdirectory, you would get an error by navigating directly
    to a URL such as <literal>http://sp.example.com:8080/openam/console/agentconfig/AgentAdd.jsp</literal>. For that
    particular endpoint, you'll have click through the options required to add an agent. (Access Control &gt;
    <replaceable>realm name</replaceable> &gt; Agents &gt; Agent &gt; New)</para>

    <para>In general, this chapter does not include dynamic endpoints, such as those that may include security
        tokens. The endpoints described in this chapter are based on files included in the installation of an OpenAM
        server.</para>

    <para>There have been two security advisories related to OpenAM endpoints: <link xlink:show="new"
     xlink:href="http://www.forgerock.org/security_advisory1.html">OpenAM Security Advisory #201203</link> and
        <link xlink:show="new"
     xlink:href="http://www.forgerock.org/security_advisory2.html">OpenAM Security Advisory #201204</link>
 </para>

 <itemizedlist>
    <para>Several options are available for endpoints at risk. Recommendations from the noted security advisories
        include the following:</para>

    <listitem>
        <para>Filter requests to prevent or restrict access to vulnerable endpoints with a reverse proxy or
            equivalent hardware device. Such options can be configured to limit access by IP address or
            fully-qualified domain name.</para>
    </listitem>

     <listitem>
         <para>Use a patch. If available, download links should be listed in the security advisory. The patch
         may be limited to one or more endpoint files.</para>
     </listitem>

 <!--
	  Somewhere in here, you'll need to specify which are safely removable.
	  Also, how do we deal with that for upgrades? Sys admins should script this, right?
	  Or should someone develop a hardening script?
  -->
     <listitem>
         <para>Remove access from the configuration. If a problematic endpoint is configured in the web.xml file of
             the aforementioned WEB-INF subdirectory, you can remove the section that points to that endpoint.</para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
         <para>Remove the endpoint file from the configuration. Some endpoint files, such as proxy.jsp or ssoadm.jsp,
             are not essential to the basic operation of OpenAM.</para>
     </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>Of course, you can take additional steps to help secure your OpenAM deployment. For more information, see the
      the chapter on <link xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-securing"

 <para>The OpenAM WAR archive includes *.jsp files in a number of different categories. Many are associated with the
 applicable subdirectory, such as console/realm. The following sections will examine each *.jsp file, divided by
 subdirectories.</para>

 <para>In some highlighted cases, the noted *.jsp file appears in the code for one or more .java files. If you remove
 the noted *.jsp file from the container, there is a risk that will break some functionality within OpenAM. In other
 cases, such as any files related to the GUI installation wizard, the applicable *.jsp file can be safely removed
 from a production system.</para>

         REST endpoints. The descriptions are different from other endpoints in this chapter.</para>

        <!-- Given the state of development of these endpoints, I would not object if we delete this section.
        The "other XACML endpoints" are a reference to Jeff Schenk's notes on AME-928.
         In addition, Jeff says that he's planning to set up a toggle to deactivate / activate XACML
         endpoints. When that happens, I should add that info to this section. -->
