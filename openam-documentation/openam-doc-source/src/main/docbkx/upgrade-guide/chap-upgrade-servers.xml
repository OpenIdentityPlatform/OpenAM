 <title>Upgrading OpenAM Servers</title>

 <para>This chapter covers upgrade from OpenAM core server 9.5 or later to the
 current version. For other OpenAM components, see <link xlink:show="new"
 xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-backup-restore"
 xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Upgrading OpenAM
 Components</citetitle></link>.</para>

 <para>OpenAM server upgrade relies on the Upgrade Wizard to make the
 necessary changes to the configuration store. You must then restart OpenAM or
 the container in which it runs. Even a version number change requires that you
 run the Upgrade Wizard, so needing to run the Upgrade Wizard says nothing about
 the significance of the changes that have been made to OpenAM. You must run
 the Upgrade Wizard even for maintenance releases.</para>

 <para>Make sure you try upgrading OpenAM in a test environment before applying
 the upgrade in your production environment.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="upgrade-server">
  <title>To Upgrade From OpenAM 9.5 or Later</title>

  <para>Follow these steps to upgrade a site of OpenAM servers (version 9.5 or
  later). During the upgrade process, you must take the OpenAM servers in the
  site out of production, instead redirecting client application traffic
  elsewhere. This is required because upgrade involves making changes to
  OpenAM's configuration model. If the upgrade fails, you must be able to
  roll back before the configuration changes impact other sites.</para>

  <step>
   <para>Prepare your customized OpenAM server .war file.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Back up the deployment.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Route client application traffic to another site during the upgrade.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For servers in the site, stop OpenAM, or if necessary stop the
   container where OpenAM runs.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For servers in the site, deploy your customized server .war file.</para>

   <para>When you deploy the new .war file, you might have to delete working
   files left by the old installation. For example, if you deploy on Apache
   Tomcat, replacing <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam.war</filename>,
   then also recursively delete the
   <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/</filename>
   and <filename>/path/to/tomcat/work/Catalina/localhost/openam/</filename>
   directories before restarting the server.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For servers in the site, restart OpenAM or the container where it runs.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For the first server in the site, follow the instructions in the
   Upgrade Wizard.</para>

   <para>Alternatively, you can use the
   <filename><?eval ${ssoconfigUpgradeJarFile}?></filename> command-line tool
   to upgrade the server configuration. The procedure, <link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="install-guide#install-openam-config-tools"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>To Set Up
   Configuration Tools</citetitle></link>, describes how to install the
   tool.</para>
  </step>

  <step performance="optional">
   <para>If you want to configure the upgraded system with a different
   directory service for the Core Token Service (CTS), read <link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="install-guide#chap-cts" xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">
   <citetitle>Configuring the Core Token Service</citetitle></link>.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Validate that the service is performing as expected.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Allow client application traffic to flow to the upgraded site.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="after-upgrading-from-10-1">
  <title>To Complete Upgrade from OpenAM 10.1.0 Xpress</title>

   <para>When upgrading from OpenAM 10.1.0 Xpress, the upgrade tool does not
   change the Dashboard service LDAP schema, although the object IDs used in
   the Dashboard service LDAP schema definitions are not correct.</para>

   <para>You can fix the object IDs manually using the OpenDJ
   <command>ldapmodify</command> command. The command is delivered with OpenDJ
   directory server.</para>

  <step>
   <para>Update the LDAP schema defined in the OpenDJ directory server where
   OpenAM stores its configuration.</para>

   <para>Make the change on one of the replicated OpenDJ configuration
   directory servers.</para>

   <para>The example command shown below uses the <command>ldapmodify</command>
   command delivered with the embedded OpenDJ configuration directory server
   for OpenAM with deployment URI <literal>/openam</literal>. When you use the
   embedded OpenDJ configuration directory server, the password for the
   <literal>cn=Directory Manager</literal> account is the same password used
   by <literal>amadmin</literal>.</para>

   <para>The LDAP schema definitions are stored on the LDAP subentry
   with distinguished name <literal>cn=schema</literal>. You use the
   following LDIF format definitions to correct the object IDs in the
   definitions.</para>
