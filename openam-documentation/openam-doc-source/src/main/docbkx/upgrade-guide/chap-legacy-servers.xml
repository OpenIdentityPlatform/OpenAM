 <para>Rather than upgrade legacy servers (OpenAM 9.0, OpenSSO and Sun Access
 Manager servers), you instead migrate from your existing deployment to a new
 deployment.</para>
 
 <para>For complex legacy deployments, ForgeRock can assist you in the
 migration process. Send mail to <link xlink:href="mailto:info@forgerock.com"
 >info@forgerock.com</link> for more information.</para>
