 xlink:href="http://openid.net/connect/" xlink:show="new">OpenID Connect</link>
 1.0 extends OAuth 2.0 so the client can verify claims about the identity of
 the end user, get profile information about the end user, and log the user out
 at the end of the OpenAM session. OpenID Connect also makes it possible to
 discover the provider for an end user, and to register client applications
 dynamically. OpenID connect services are built on OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Token
 (JWT), WebFinger and Well-Known URIs.</para>

 <section xml:id="about-openid-connect-support">
  <title>About OpenID Connect 1.0 Support in OpenAM</title>

  <para>In its role as OpenID Provider, OpenAM lets OpenID Connect clients
  discover its capabilities, handles both dynamic and static registration of
  OpenID Connect clients, responds to client requests with authorization codes,
  access tokens, and user information according to the Basic and Implicit Client
  Profiles of OpenID Connect, and manages sessions.</para>

  <para>This section describes how OpenAM fits into the OpenID Connect picture
  in terms of the roles that it plays in basic and implicit client profiles,
  provider discovery, client registration, and session management.</para>

  <section xml:id="openam-openid-basic-client-profile">
   <title>OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile</title>

   <para>The OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile specifies how the client
   application interacts with the provider, in this case OpenAM, based on use
   of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant. The following sequence diagram shows
   successful processing from the authorization request, through grant of the
   authorization code, access token, and ID token, and optional use of the
   access token to get information about the end user.</para>

   <para>In addition to what OAuth 2.0 specifies, OpenID Connect uses an ID
   token so the client can validate claims about the end user. It also defines
   how to get user information such as profile, email, address, and phone
   details from the UserInfo endpoint with a valid access token.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="openam-openid-implicit-client-profile">
   <title>OpenID Connect Implicit Client Profile</title>

   <para>The OpenID Connect Implicit Client Profile specifies how the client
   application interacts with the provider, in this case OpenAM, based on
   use of the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant. The following sequence diagram shows
   successful processing from the authorization request, through grant of the
   access and ID tokens, and optional use of the access token to get information
   about the end user.</para>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="openam-openid-discovery">
   <title>OpenID Connect Discovery</title>

   <para>OpenID Connect defines how a client application can discover the
   OpenID connect provider and corresponding OpenID Connect configuration for
   an end user. The discovery mechanism relies on WebFinger to get the
   information based on the end user's identifier. The server returns the
   information in JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD) format.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="openam-openid-client-registration">
   <title>OpenID Connect Client Registration</title>

   <para>OpenID Connect clients can register with OpenAM as a provider both
   statically, as for other OAuth 2.0 clients, and also dynamically as specified
   by OpenID Connect. To allow dynamic registration, you register an initial
   client that other clients can use to get access tokens for registration.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="openam-openid-session-management">
   <title>OpenID Connect Session Management</title>

   <para>OpenID Connect lets the client track whether the end user is logged in
   at the provider, and also initiate end user logout at the provider. The
   specification has the client application monitor session state using an
   invisible iframe and communicate status using the HTML 5 postMessage
   API.</para>

  <title>Configuring OpenAM As an OpenID Connect Provider</title>

  <para>You can configure OpenAM's OAuth 2.0 authorization service to double
  as an OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider. To do so, make sure that the Response Type
  Plugins list includes at least the default plugin classes.</para>

  <para>See <link xlink:href="admin-guide#configure-oauth2-authz"

 <section xml:id="configure-openid-connect-discovery">
  <title>Configuring OpenAM For OpenID Connect Discovery</title>

  <para>In order to allow clients to discover the provider for an end user,
  OpenAM supports OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0. In addition to discovering
  the provider for an end user, the client can also request the OpenID
  Connect Provider configuration.</para>
  
  <para>OpenAM as OpenID Connect Provider exposes two endpoints for
  discovery:</para>

  <simplelist type="vert" columns="1">
   <member><literal>/.well-known/webfinger</literal></member>
   <member><literal>/.well-known/openid-configuration</literal></member>
  </simplelist>
  
  <para>A client needs to be able to discover the provider for an end user. In
  this case you should consider redirecting requests to URIs at the server root,
  such as <literal>http://www.example.com/.well-known/webfinger</literal>
  and <literal>http://www.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration</literal>,
  to these Well-Known URIs in OpenAM's space.</para>

  <para>Discovery relies on <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger"
  >WebFinger</link>, a protocol to discover information about people and other
  entities using standard HTTP methods. WebFinger uses <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785">Well-Known URIs</link>,
  which defines the path prefix <literal>/.well-known/</literal> for the
  URLs defined by OpenID Connect Discovery.</para>
  
  <para>Unless you deploy OpenAM in the root context of a container listening
  on port 80 on the primary host for your domain, clients need to find
  the right <replaceable>host:port/deployment-uri</replaceable> combination
  to locate the well-known endpoints. Therefore you must manage the redirection
  to OpenAM. If you are using WebFinger for something else than OpenID Connect
  Discovery, then you probably also need proxy logic to route the requests.</para>

  <para>To retrieve the provider for an end user, the client needs the
  following.</para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>host</literal></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>The server where the client can access the WebFinger service.</para>

     <para>Notice that this is a host name rather than a URL to the endpoint,
     which is why you might need to redirect clients appropriately as described
     above.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>resource</literal></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>Identifies the end user that is the subject of the request.</para>

     <para>The client must percent-encode the resource value when using it in
     the query string of the request, so when using the "acct" URI scheme and
     the resource is <literal>acct:user@example.com</literal>, then the value
     to use is <literal>acct%3Auser%40example.com</literal>.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>rel</literal></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>URI identifying the type of service whose location is requested.</para>

     <para>In this case <literal>http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer</literal>,
     which is <literal>http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer</literal>.</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>Ignoring the question of redirection, you can test the endpoint for the
  demo user account (output lines folded to make them easier to read).</para>

  <screen>$ curl "https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/.well-known/webfinger
 ?resource=acct%3Ademo%40example.com

  <para>This shows that the OpenID Connect Provider for the OpenAM demo user is

   <step>
    <para>In the OpenAM console under Access Control &gt; <replaceable>Realm

  xlink:show="new">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0</link> specification,
  OpenAM's OpenID Connect provider exposes both a "check_session_iframe" URL
  that allows the client to receive notifications when the end user's session
  state changes at the provider, and also an "end_session_endpoint" URL to
  which to redirect an end user for logout.</para>

  <para>When registering your client that uses session management, you set the

   <para>OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0 is designed for web-based
   relying parties that use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant type.
   This grant type makes it possible for the client to get the access code
   by using the authorization code directly, without passing through the end
   user's browser. To protect its client secret (password), part of the
   client must run on the server.</para>

   <para>In the example, the Basic Client Profile Start Page describes the
   prerequisite configuration, which must be part of the client profile stored
   in the OpenAM realm where you set up the OpenID Provider. In OpenAM console,
