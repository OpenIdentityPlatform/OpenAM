 <para>This chapter identifies best practices for securing your OpenAM
 deployment.</para>

  <title>Avoiding Obvious Defaults</title>

  <itemizedlist>
   <para>OpenAM includes default settings to make it easier for you to
   evaluate the software. Avoid these default settings in production
   deployments.</para>

   <listitem>
    <para>When connecting to LDAP, bind with a specific administrative account
    rather than a root DN account if possible.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Change the default <literal>iPlanetDirectoryPro</literal> cookie name
    both in OpenAM (<literal>com.iplanet.am.cookie.name</literal>) and in your
    policy agent profiles (<literal
    >com.sun.identity.agents.config.cookie.name</literal>).</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>When installing OpenAM, do not use <literal>/openam</literal> or
    <literal>/opensso</literal> as the deployment URI.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Set valid goto URL domains for OpenAM in the core authentication
    module configuration. The parameter is described in the section providing
    <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="admin-guide#core-module-conf-hints"

   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Create an administrator in the top-level realm with a different ID

   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Create specific administrator users to track better who makes
    configuration changes.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Set the OpenAM advanced property
    <literal>openam.auth.soap.rest.generic.authentication.exception</literal>
    to <literal>true</literal>. This causes OpenAM to return the same exception
    both when the user does not exist, and also when the password is not
    valid.</para>

 <section xml:id="protect-network-access">
  <title>Protecting Network Access</title>

   <para>Anytime users interact with a web service, there are risks. With OpenAM, you can
   reduce those risks by deploying different parts of OpenAM in appropriate parts of an
   enterprise network.</para>

    <para>To minimize risks, deploy only the core OpenAM server on systems directly connected
        through a firewall. As a start, deploy only the core server (and the protected web application)
        on Internet-facing servers. For instructions, see the following section from the
        OpenAM Installation Guide, <link xlink:href="install-guide#which-war-to-deploy"
        xlink:show="new" xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Determine Which
        War File to Deploy</citetitle></link>.</para>

    <para>You can further limit what is exposed through the firewall by using one of two strategies:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Set up a distributed authentication user interface (UI) in a DMZ between firewalls.</para>
            <para>The distributed authentication UI is essentially a small subset of the OpenAM server with
            just enough login logic to receive user authentication requests. Those requests are forwarded
            to the core OpenAM servers.</para>
            <para>See <link xlink:href="install-guide#chap-install-das"

        <para>You can make changes to the password and user name for the main OpenAM administrative account.</para>
        <para>You can change the user name of the <literal>amadmin</literal> administrative account
            to something more obscure, such as superroot. However, the capabilities of that alternative administrative
            account would not be complete, due to some hard-coding of <literal>amadmin</literal> in the source files.
            When changing the password for the main OpenAM administrative account, you must make a corresponding change
            to the authentication datastore. That datastore could be OpenDJ. The steps you would take to change
            the OpenAM top-level administrative password and account name are shown in the following sections.</para>

            </step>
            <step>
                <para>You'll also need to change the password for the administrator on the directory server. If you are
                    using OpenDJ, refer to the <link xlink:show="new"

        </procedure>

        <para>In the following steps, you will identify the new administrative user by assigning it to the <literal>
            com.sun.identity.authentication.super.user</literal> directive. You may also need to create an
            OpenAM account for the new administrative user. Don't forget to make sure that new administrative
            account is configured in the corresponding directory server such as OpenDJ.

                <para>You'll see blank entries in the end of the list of Property Names and Property Values. In the

                <para>In the corresponding Property Values test box, enter appropriate values for the new administrative
                    user in LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). For example, the following entry would set up an
                    administrative user named <literal>superroot</literal>, in the organizational unit named <literal>
                        people</literal>people, associated with the example.com domain:

                <para>Click Save to save the changes that you've made. </para>
            </step>
            <step>
                <para>If the account doesn't already exist in OpenAM or on a connected directory server, you'll need to
               create it. To do so, select Access Control &gt; / (Top Level Realm) &gt; Subject &gt; User &gt; New.
               In the New User window that appears, create the new user. Make sure to enter an appropriate password
               and make that user Active. The ID for that new user is the user name.</para>
            </step>
            <step>
                <para>As noted earlier, you'll also need to make sure that the corresponding account on the directory server
                has at least CN=Directory Manager  privileges. If you're using OpenDJ, refer to the chapter on
                    <citetitle>Configuring Privileges &amp; Access Control</citetitle> in the
                    <link xlink:show="new"
                    xlink:href="http://docs.forgerock.org/en/opendj/2.6.0/admin-guide#chap-privileges-acis">
                    <citetitle>OpenDJ Administration Guide</citetitle></link>.</para>
            </step>
        </procedure>

        <para>If you do change the account name of the top-level administrative account, you should be aware that the
        original <literal>amadmin</literal> account is "hard-coded" in the source code of several files.
            The code in these files may affect the functionality of a top-level administrative user
            with a name other than <literal>amadmin</literal>.</para>

        <para>One of the improvements that we plan to make to OpenAM is to eliminate these instances of hard-coding.
        Until we make such improvements, the amadmin user would retain privileges related to the LoginState and some
        IDM-related classes.</para>
