 <title>Managing SAML 2.0 Federation</title>

 <para>This chapter addresses how to set up and manage SAML 2.0 SSO for
 single sign on and single log out across resources belonging to
 organizations participating in a circle of trust.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="about-federation">
  <title>About SAML 2.0 SSO &amp; Federation</title>
  <indexterm><primary>Federation</primary></indexterm>
  <para>SAML 2.0 SSO is part of federated access management. Federation lets
  access management cross organizational boundaries. Federation helps
  organizations share identities and services without giving away their
  identity information, or the services they provide.</para>
  
  <para>To bridge heterogeneous systems, federation requires interoperability,
  and thus depends on standards for orchestrating interaction and exchanging
  information between providers. OpenAM federation relies on standards such as
  <link xlink:href="http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications">Security Assertion
  Markup Language (SAML) 2.0</link>. SAML 2.0 describes the messages, how they
  are relayed, how they are exchanged, and common use cases.</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>To achieve SAML 2.0 SSO, OpenAM separates <firstterm>identity
   providers</firstterm> from <firstterm>service providers</firstterm>,
   lets you include them them in a <firstterm>circle of trust</firstterm>, and
   has you configure how the providers in the circle of trust interact.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>An identity provider stores and serves identity profiles, and
    handles authentication.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A service provider offers services that access protected
    resources, and handles authorization.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A circle of trust groups at least one identity provider and at least
    one service provider who agree to share authentication information, with
    assertions about authenticated users that let service providers make
    authorization decisions.</para>
    <para>Providers in a circle of trust share <firstterm>metadata</firstterm>,
    configuration information that federation partners require to access each
    others' services.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>SAML 2.0 SSO maps attributes from accounts at the identity provider to
    attributes on accounts at the service provider. The identity provider makes
    assertions to the service provider, for example to attest that a user has
    authenticated with the identity provider. The service provider then
    consumes assertions from the identity provider to make authorization
    decisions, for example to let an authenticated user complete a purchase
    that gets charged to the user's account at the identity provider.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>In federation deployments where not all providers support SAML 2.0,
  OpenAM can act as a multi-protocol hub, translating for providers who rely
  on other and older standards such as SAML 1.x, Liberty Alliance Project
  frameworks, and WS-Federation (for integration with Active Directory
  Federation Services, for example).</para>

  <title>Setting Up SAML 2.0 SSO</title>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>Before you set up SAML 2.0 SSO in OpenAM, you must:</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>Know which providers participate in the circle of trust.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Know how your OpenAM installations act as identity providers, or
    service providers.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Agree with other providers on a synchronized clock or time service
    to share for provider systems.</para>
    <para>Processing messages you exchange requires synchronized time
    keeping.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>For identity information exchanged with other participants in a
    circle of trust, define how to map user attributes you share. Your user
    profile attribute names map to user profile attribute names at other
    providers.</para>
    <para>For example, if you exchange user identifiers with your partners, and
    you call it <literal>uid</literal> whereas another partner calls it
    <literal>userid</literal>, then you map your <literal>uid</literal> to
    your partner's <literal>userid</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Import the keys used to sign assertions into the JKS key store in
    your OpenAM configuration directory. You can use the Java
    <command>keytool</command> command.</para>
    <para>The OpenAM configuration key store is located at the top level of
    the configuration directory, such as
    <filename>$HOME/openam/keystore.jks</filename>. The password,
    stored in <filename>$HOME/openam/.keypass</filename>, is
    <literal>changeit</literal> by default. Also by default the only key
    available is for a self-signed certificate (alias: test) installed with
    OpenAM.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>During set up, you must share metadata for providers that you host
  with other providers in the circle of trust. You must also configure
  remote providers, connecting to other providers by importing their
  metadata.</para>
  
   <para>In OpenAM terms, a hosted provider is one served by the current
   OpenAM server, whereas a remote provider is one hosted elsewhere.</para>

   <title>Deploying the Identity Provider Discovery Service</title>
   
   <para>When your circle of trust includes multiple identity providers, then
   service providers must discover which identity provider corresponds to a
   request. You can deploy the identity provider discovery service for this
   purpose as a separate web application.</para>

   <para>Browsers only send cookies for the originating domain. Therefore
   when a browser accesses the service provider in the <literal>www.sp.example</literal>
   domain, the service provider has no way of knowing whether the user has
   perhaps already authenticated at <literal>www.this-idp.example</literal> or at
   <literal>www.that-idp.example</literal>. The providers therefore host an identity
   provider discovery service in a common domain, such as
   <literal>www.disco.example</literal>, and use that service to discover where
   the user logged in. The identity provider discover service essentially
   writes and reads cookies from the common domain. The providers configure
   their circle of trust to use the identity provider discovery service
   as part of SAML 2.0 federation.</para>

  </indexterm>

  <para>OpenAM SAML 2.0 Federation provides JSPs where you can direct
  users to do single sign-on (SSO) and single logout (SLO) across providers
  in a circle of trust. OpenAM has two JSPs for SSO and two JSPs for
  SLO, allowing you to initiate both processes either from the identity
  provider side, or from the service provider side.</para>

  <para>SSO lets users sign in once and remain authenticated as they access
  services in the circle of trust.</para>

  <para>SLO attempts to log a user out of all providers in the circle of
  trust.</para>

  </indexterm>

  <para>The SAML 2.0 Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) profile is intended for use
  when accessing services over devices like simple phones, medical devices, and
  set-top boxes that lack the capabilities needed to use the more widely used
  SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO profile.</para>

  <para>The ECP knows which identity provider to contact for the user, and is
  able to use the reverse SOAP (PAOS) SAML 2.0 binding for the authentication
  request and response. The PAOS binding uses HTTP and SOAP headers to pass
  information about processing SOAP requests and responses, starting with a
  PAOS HTTP header that the ECP sends in its initial request to the server.
  The PAOS messages continue with a SOAP authentication request in the server's
  HTTP response to the ECP's request for a resource, followed by a SOAP
  response in an HTTP request from the ECP.</para>

  <para>An enhanced client, such as a browser with a plugin or an extension,
  can handle these communications on its own. An enhanced proxy is an HTTP
  server such as a WAP gateway that can support the ECP profile on behalf of
  client applications.</para>

  <para>OpenAM supports the SAML 2.0 ECP profile on the server side for
  identity providers and service providers. You must build the ECP.</para>

  <para>By default an OpenAM identity provider uses the
  <literal>com.sun.identity.saml2.plugins.DefaultIDPECPSessionMapper</literal>
  class to find a user session for requests to the IDP from the ECP. The
  default session mapper uses OpenAM cookies as it would for any other client
  application. If for some reason you must change the mapping after writing
  and installing your own session mapper, you can change the class under
  Federation &gt; Entity Providers &gt; <replaceable>idp-name</replaceable>
  &gt; IDP &gt; Advanced &gt; ECP Configuration.</para>

  <para>By default an OpenAM service provider uses the
  <literal>com.sun.identity.saml2.plugins.ECPIDPFinder</literal> class to
  return identity providers from the list under Federation &gt; Entity
  Providers &gt; <replaceable>sp-name</replaceable> &gt; SP &gt; Advanced

  <para>Identity providers and service providers must be able to communicate
  about users. Yet in some cases the identity provider can choose to communicate
  a minimum of information about an authenticated user, with no user account
  maintained on the service provider side. In other cases the identity provider
  and service provider can choose to link user accounts in a persistent way, in
  a more permanent way, or even in automatic fashion by using some shared value
  in the user's profiles such as an email address or by dynamically creating

   <title>Linking Federated Accounts in Bulk</title>

   <para>If you manage both the identity provider and service provider, you
   can link accounts out-of-band, in bulk. You make permanent connections for a
   list of identity provider and service provider by using the
   <command>ssoadm</command> bulk federation commands.</para>

   <para>Before you can run the bulk federation commands, first establish the
   relationship between accounts, set up the providers as described in
   <xref linkend="set-up-federation" />, and install the
   <command>ssoadm</command> command as described in <link
   xlink:href="install-guide#install-openam-admin-tools"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>To Set Up
   Administration Tools</citetitle></link>.</para>

   <para>To understand the relationships between accounts, consider an example
   where the identity provider is at <literal>idp.example.org</literal> and the
   service provider is at <literal>sp.example</literal>. A demo user
   account has the Universal ID,
   <literal>id=demo,ou=user,dc=example,dc=org</literal>, on the identity
   provider. That maps to the Universal ID,
   <literal>id=demo,ou=user,dc=example,dc=com</literal>, on the service
   provider.</para>

   <para>The <command>ssoadm</command> command then needs a file that maps
   local user IDs to remote user IDs, one per line, separated by the vertical
   bar character <literal>|</literal>. Each line of the file appears as
   follows.</para>

   <literallayout class="monospaced"><replaceable>local-user-ID</replaceable
   >|<replaceable>remote-user-ID</replaceable></literallayout>

   <para>In the example, starting on the service provider side, the line for
   the demo user reads as follows.</para>

   <literallayout class="monospaced"
   >id=demo,ou=user,dc=example,dc=com|id=demo,ou=user,dc=example,dc=org</literallayout>

   <para>All the users’ accounts mapped in your file must exist at the identity
   provider and the service provider when you run the commands to link
   them.</para>

    <para>Link the accounts using the <command>ssoadm</command> bulk federation
    commands.</para>

    <listitem>
     <para>Prepare the data with the
     <command>ssoadm do-bulk-federation</command> command.</para>

     <para>The following example starts on the service provider side.</para>

     <screen>$ cat /tmp/user-map.txt

federation, name Id mapping file should be loaded to remote

    <listitem>
     <para>Import the name ID mapping file with the

     side.</para>

     <screen>$ ssoadm import-bulk-fed-data
 --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt
 --metaalias /idp --bulk-data-file /tmp/name-map.txt

 <section xml:id="using-saml2-artifacts">
  <title>Using SAML 2.0 Artifacts</title>

  <para>By default OpenAM transmits SAML messages by value. This makes it
  possible to access the SAML messages in the user agent. You can instead
  request that OpenAM transmit SAML messages by reference using SAML artifacts,
  which are small values that reference a SAML message. Providers then
  communicate directly to resolve artifacts, rather than sending the messages
  through the user agent.</para>

  <para>When initiating single sign-on using <filename>idpSSOInit.jsp</filename>
  or <filename>spSSOInit.jsp</filename> for example, add
  <literal>binding=HTTP-Artifact</literal> to the list of query parameters.
  The following example works in an environment where the identity provider is
  <literal>www.idp.example</literal> and the service provider is
  <literal>www.sp.example</literal>. Both providers have deployed OpenAM on port
  8080 under deployment URI <literal>/openam</literal>.</para>
