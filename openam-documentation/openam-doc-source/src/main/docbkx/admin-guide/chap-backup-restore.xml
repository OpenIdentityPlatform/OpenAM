 <title>Backing Up and Restoring OpenAM Configurations</title>
 
 <para>This chapter shows how to backup and restore OpenAM configuration
 data. This chapter <emphasis>does not cover backup and restore of user
 data</emphasis>, which in a critical production system should be stored
 separately.</para>
 
 <procedure xml:id="backup-config-to-xml">
  <title>To Back Up OpenAM Configuration</title>
  <indexterm><primary>Backup</primary></indexterm>
  <para>OpenAM stores service configuration data in a directory. During normal
  production operations, you rely on directory replication to maintain multiple,
  current copies of OpenAM service configuration. For disaster recovery,
  however, you backup to and restore the service configuration from XML, using
  the <command>ssoadm</command> command.</para>
  
  <step>
   <para>Backup OpenAM service configuration using the
   <command>ssoadm</command> command.</para>
   <screen>$ ssoadm export-svc-cfg -u amadmin -e fZatIu68OiqccJMXosSRyVjMsWJIx+SA
 -f /tmp/pwd.txt -o ~/backup-`date -u +%F-%m-%S`.xml

Service Configuration was exported.</screen>
   <para>In this example, the secret key for encrypting the password in
   <option>-e fZatIu68OiqccJMXosSRyVjMsWJIx+SA</option> was taken from the
   Password Encryption Key field in the OpenAM console under Configuration &gt;
   Servers and Sites &gt; <replaceable>Server Name</replaceable> &gt;
   Security.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Stop OpenAM.</para>

  <step>
   <para>Back up the instance file that points to the configuration
   directory.</para>
   <para>This file is named after the instance location, such as
   <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/AMConfig_path_to_tomcat_webapps_openam_</filename>,
   where $HOME is the home directory of the user running the web container where OpenAM
   is deployed.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Back up the files in the configuration directory.</para>
   <para>The content of the file you backed up in the previous step is the
   path to the configuration directory, such as
   <filename>$HOME/openam</filename>.</para>

  <para>The following steps restore OpenAM configuration data from
  backup as described in <xref linkend="backup-config-to-xml" />.</para>
  
  <tip>
   <para>If using the default OpenAM configuration data store, run
   <command>ssoadm embedded-status</command> to check the data store status
   to determine whether you must restore the configuration files including
   the embedded data store, or only the service configuration.</para>
  </tip>
  
  <step>
   <para>Deploy the OpenAM web application as you did for installation, but
   do not start OpenAM or configure it.</para>
   <para>In a site configuration, perform this step on all servers.</para>

   <para>Restore files in the configuration directory as necessary.</para>
   <para>In a site configuration, perform this step on all servers.</para>

   <para>In a site configuration, you perform this step only once.</para>
   <para>If the password for <literal>amadmin</literal> has been changed
   through the OpenAM console, then use the bind password for the root DN of
