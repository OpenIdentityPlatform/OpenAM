 <title>Configuring Cross-Domain Single Sign On</title>

 <para>This chapter shows you how to configure cross-domain single sign on
 (CDSSO). When you have multiple domains in a single organization, CDSSO lets
 your OpenAM servers in one domain work with policy agents from other
 domains.</para>

 <para>CDSSO is an OpenAM-specific capability. For single sign on across
 multiple organizations or when integrating with other access management
 software, use OpenAM's federation capabilities.</para>

 <indexterm><primary>Cross-domain single sign on (CDSSO)</primary></indexterm>
 <para><firstterm>Cross-domain single sign on</firstterm> provides
 a safe mechanism for managing access across multiple different domains that
 you control. CDSSO lets OpenAM authenticate users redirected by policy agents
 in other DNS domains.</para>

 <para>Single sign on depends on cookies to store session information. Yet for
 for security reasons, browsers do not let a web site in one domain to get
 access to a cookie from another domain. With CDSSO, the policy agents work
 around this by negotiating with OpenAM to allow access.</para>

 <para>The Java EE policy agent allows CDSSO by using a mechanism to write
 the SSO token from OpenAM authentication to a cookie with the domain
 the host where the agent runs. The following sequence diagram illustrates
 this mechanism.</para>

 <para>Whereas the Java EE policy agent has an endpoint specifically to handle
 the cookie domain translation, the web policy agent handles the request
 directly as shown in the following sequence diagram.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="enable-cdsso-cookie-hijacking-protection">
  <title>To Protect Against CDSSO Cookie Hijacking</title>

  <para>When cookies are set for an entire domain such as
  <literal>.example.com</literal>, an attacker who steals a cookie can use it
  from any host in the domain such as <literal>untrusted.example.com</literal>.
  Cookie hijacking protection restricts cookies to the fully-qualified domain
  name (FQDN) of the host where they are issued, such as
  <literal>openam-server.example.com</literal> and
  <literal>server-with-agent.example.com</literal>, using CDSSO to handle
  authentication and authorization.</para>

  <para>For CDSSO with cookie hijacking protection, when a client successfully
  authenticates OpenAM issues the master SSO token cookie for its FQDN.
  OpenAM issues <firstterm>restricted token</firstterm> cookies for the
  other FQDNs where the policy agents reside. The client ends up with cookies
  having different session identifiers for different FQDNs, and the OpenAM
  server stores the correlation between the master SSO token and restricted
  tokens, such that the client only has one master session internally in
  OpenAM.</para>

  <para>To protect against cookie hijacking you restrict the OpenAM server
  domain to the server where OpenAM runs. This sets the domain of the SSO token
  cookie to the host running the OpenAM server that issued the token. You also
  enable use of a unique SSO token cookie. For your Java EE policy agents, you
  enable use of the unique SSO token cookie in the agent configuration as
  well.</para>

   <title>Using SAML 2.0 With Policy Agents</title>

   <para>The federation mechanism associated with SAML can be used as an alternative to
   CDSSO for both Web and Java EE policy agents. This assumes OpenAM is configured as an
   IDP on one domain, and the desired policy agent protects resources on behalf of a second
   instance of OpenAM, where that instance acts as an SP on a second domain.</para>

   <para>While using SAML 2.0 adds complexity, it supports attribute
   mapping, which may be useful when the two domains are associated with datastores
   with different attributes.</para>

   <step>
    <para>Install a policy agent. The basic process for installing policy agents is available in the
