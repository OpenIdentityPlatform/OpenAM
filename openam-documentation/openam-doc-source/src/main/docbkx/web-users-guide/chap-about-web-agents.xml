 <title>About OpenAM Web Policy Agents</title>

 <para>OpenAM web policy agents provide light touch integration for web
  applications running on supported web servers.
  This chapter covers what web policy agents do and how they work.</para>
 
 <para>A <firstterm>policy agent</firstterm> enforces policy for OpenAM and protects
  all resources on the web server.
  The policy agent intercepts requests from users trying to access a protected
  web resource and denies access until the user has authorization from OpenAM
  to access the resource.</para>

 <note xml:id="one-agent-per-server">
  <para>
   A single policy agent can work with multiple applications.
   You therefore install only one policy agent per web server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Installing more than one policy agent in a web server is not supported.
  </para>
 </note>

 <section xml:id="web-agent-components">
  <title>Web Policy Agent Components</title>
  <para>The web policy agent provides fast installation and light touch integration
   to protect the resources on the supported web server. The web agent consists
   a web server plug-in matching the API requirements of the particular web server
   and a native module that interfaces with OpenAM for its services.

 <section xml:id="filter-modes">
  <title>Web Agent Filter Modes of Operation</title>
  <para>The agent filter intercepts all inbound client requests
   to access a protected resource and processes the request based on
   a global configuration property,
   <literal>com.sun.identity.agents.config.filter.mode</literal>, set in
   the policy agent profile on OpenAM.
   The configuration setting determines the
   filter mode of operation that should be carried out on the intercepted
   inbound request.
  </para>

  <para>The filter modes are the following:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">SSO_ONLY</emphasis>.
     Specifies that authentication should be enforced to all users who try
     to access protected web resources. The filter invokes the OpenAM
     Authentication service to verify the identity of the user.
     If the user's identity is verified, the user is issued a session token
     through OpenAM's Session service. By default, this is enabled.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you only want SSO_ONLY mode, you can enable the property
     <literal>com.sun.identity.agents.config.sso.only</literal> using the OpenAM
     console.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">URL_POLICY</emphasis>.
     Specifies that authorization should be enforced only
     by OpenAM's URL resource-based policies.
     By default, this is enabled.
    </para>
   </listitem>

 <section xml:id="web-agent-not-enforced-list">
  <title>Not-Enforced URL and Client IP Lists</title>
  <para>The policy agent supports properties to bypass authentication
   and grant immediate access to resources not requiring protection, such
   as images, stylesheets, or static HTML pages.</para>

  <para>
   You can configure a Not-Enforced URL List using the
   <literal>com.sun.identity.agents.config.notenforced.url</literal> property
   that grants the user access to resources whose URLs match those in the list.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, you can set URL patterns with wildcards in the OpenAM console
   using the following patterns:</para>
  <screen>
   /logout.html
   /images/*
   /css/-*-
   /*.jsp?locale=*
  </screen>

  <para>For more information on wildcard usage, see

         xlink:href="admin-guide#wildcard-syntax"
         xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">Wildcard Usage</link>.
  </para>

  <para>The policy agent also supports a Not-Enforced Client IP List, which
   specifies the client IP addresses that can be excluded from authentication
   and authorization. This property is useful to allow administrators access
   to the web site from a certain IP address or allow a search engine access
   to the web resources.
  </para>

 <section xml:id="example-agent-interaction">
  <title>How the User, Web Policy Agent, &amp; OpenAM Interact</title>

  <para>Imagine that a user attempts to access a protected resource before
   having authenticated by pointing her browser to a web page. Assume that you
   have configured OpenAM to protect the web page. Then the web policy agent
   intercepting her browser's request finds no session token in the request,
   and so redirects the user's browser to the OpenAM login page for
   authentication. After the user has successfully authenticated, OpenAM
   sets a session token in a browser cookie, and redirects her browser back to
   the page she tried to access initially.</para>

  <para>When the user's browser reiterates the request, the policy agent again
   checks that the request has a session token, finds a session token this
   time, and validates the session token with OpenAM. Given the valid session
   token, the policy agent gets a policy decision from OpenAM concerning whether
   the user can access the page. If OpenAM's Policy Service determines that
   the user is allowed to access the page, OpenAM responds to the policy agent
   that access should be granted. The web policy agent then permits the web
   page to be returned to the user's browser.</para>

  <para>The following diagram shows how the pieces fit together when a web
   client accesses a web page protected by a policy agent. This diagram is
   simplified to show only the essential principals rather than to describe
   every possible case.</para>

 <section xml:id="web-agent-features">
  <title>Web Policy Agent Features</title>
  <para>The Web policy agent provides a number of additional features
   useful for your deployment, some of which are described below:
  </para>

  <section xml:id="web-agent-attribute-fetching">
   <title>Attribute Fetch Modes</title>

   <!-- TODO: Add examples/user cases of each type of attribute fetch -->
   <para>Web policy agents provides the capability
    to fetch and inject user information into HTTP headers, request objects, and
    cookies and pass them on to the protected client applications.
    The client applications can then personalize content using these attributes
    in their web pages or responses.
   </para>
   <para>Specifically, you can configure the type of
    attributes to be fetched and the associated mappings for the attributes
    names used on OpenAM to those values used in the containers. The web
    policy agent securely fetches the user and session data from the
    authenticated user as well as policy response attributes.
   </para>
   <para>For example, you can have a web page that addresses the user by name
    retrieved from the user profile, e.g. "Welcome Your Name!"
    OpenAM populates part of the request (header, form data) with the CN from
    the user profile, and the web site consumes and displays it.</para>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="agent-login-attempt-limits">
   <title>Login Attempt Limits</title>
   <para>When the user-agent does not present a valid SSO token, the agent
    will redirect the user to the login URL configured in OpenAM.

    The web policy agent can be configured to limit the login attempts
    made to the policy agent to mitigate against any redirect loops that may result
    in an error page presented to the end-user.</para>
   <para>
    You can use the <literal>com.sun.identity.agents.config.login.attempt.limit</literal>
    property to specify a non-zero value for the number of login attempts.
    For example, if the property is set to 3, then the agent will block the access
    request to the protected resource on the fourth login request.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can also limit the number of redirections the agent can take for a single
    browser session by setting the
    <literal>com.sun.identity.agents.config.redirect.attempt.limit</literal>.
   </para>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="fqdn-checking">
   <title>FQDN Checking</title>
   <para>The web policy agent requires that clients accessing
    protected resources use valid URLs with fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
    If invalid URLs are referenced, policy evaluation can
    fail as the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) will not match the requested
    URL, leading to blocked access to the resource.
    Misconfigured URLs can also result in incorrect policy evaluation for
    subsequent access requests.
   </para>
   <para>There are cases where clients may specify resource URLs that differ from
    the FQDNs stored in OpenAM policies, for example, in load
    balanced and virtual host environments. To handle these cases,
    the web policy agent supports FQDN Checking properties:
    <literal>FQDN Default</literal>
    and <literal>FQDN Virtual Host Map</literal> properties.
   </para>
   <para>The <literal>FQDN Default</literal> property specifies the default URL
    with valid hostname.
    The property ensures that the policy agent can redirect to
    a URL with a valid hostname should it discover an invalid URL in the client request.</para>
   <para>The <literal>FQDN Virtual Host Map</literal> property stores map keys
    and their corresponding values, allowing invalid URLs, load balanced URLs,
    and virtual host URLs to be correctly mapped to valid URLs.
    Each entry in the Map has precedence over the <literal>FQDN Default</literal>
    setting, so that if no valid URLs exist in the <literal>FQDN Virtual Host Map</literal>
    property, the agent redirects to
    the value specified in the <literal>FQDN Default</literal> property.
   </para>
   <para>If you want the agent to redirect to a URL other than the one specified
    in the <literal>FQDN Default</literal> property, then it is good practice to
    include any anticipated invalid URLs in the <literal>FQDN Virtual Host Map</literal> property
    and map it to a valid URL.

  <section xml:id="cookie-reset">
   <title>Cookie Reset Properties</title>
   <para>OpenAM provides cookie reset properties that the agent carries out
    prior to redirecting the client to a login page for authentication.
   </para>
   <para>Cookie reset is typically used when multiple parallel authentication
    mechanisms are in play with the policy agent and another authentication system.
    The policy agent can reset the cookies set by the other mechanism before
    redirecting the client to a login page.
   </para>
   <para>The cookie reset properties include a name list specifying all of the
    cookies that will reset, a domain map specifying the domains set for each cookie,
    and a path map specifying the path from which the cookie will be reset.
   </para>
   <para>If you have enabled attribute fetching using cookies to retrieve user
    data, it is good practice to use cookie reset, which will reset once you want
    to access an enforced URL without a valid session.
   </para>
   <para>For more details, see

  </section>

  <section xml:id="agent-cdsso">
   <title>Cross Domain Single Sign-On</title>
   <para>Cross domain single sign-on (CDSSO) allows the web policy agent
    to transfer a validated session ID between an OpenAM domain and an application
    domain using a proprietary OpenAM mechanism.
    Normally, single sign-on cannot be implemented across domains as the session
    cookie from one domain (for example, website.com) is not accessible from
    another domain (for example, website.net).
   </para>
   <para>
    OpenAM's CDSSO solves this cross-domain problem and is best implemented in environments
    where all the domains are managed ultimately by the same organization.
   </para>
   <para>
    The web policy agent works with an OpenAM component called
    a <literal>CDCServlet</literal> that generates a
    self-submitting form containing
    the valid session token from one domain.
    The form gets auto-submitted to the policy agent endpoint via a POST
    operation.
    The policy agent processes the request and extracts the session ID, which is
    again validated by OpenAM. If validation is successful,
    the policy agent sets the cookie in alternate domain. The
    client can then access a resource in that domain.
   </para>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="web-agent-load-balancer">
   <title>Load Balancer</title>
   <para>The web policy agent provides a number of advanced properties for
    load balancer deployments fronting multiple policy agents.
    Properties are available to get the client IP and host name from the load
    balancer.
   </para>

   <para>If the policy agent is running behind a load balancer,
    you can configure the policy agent to set a stick cookie or a query parameter
    in the URL to ensure
    subsequent requests are routed to the same instance to preserve session
    data.
   </para>
   <para>
    These mechanisms ensures that unauthenticated POST data can be
    preserved. Policy agents store POST data in the cache and do not share the data
    among the agents behind the load balancer.
   </para>

 <section xml:id="web-agent-configuration">
  <title>How Web Policy Agents are Configured</title>
  
  <para>You install web policy agents in the web servers holding web resources
  that you want to protect. By default, the web policy agent has only enough
  configuration at installation time to connect to OpenAM in order to get the
  rest of its configuration from the OpenAM configuration store. With nearly
  all configuration stored centrally, you can manage policy agents centrally
  from the OpenAM console.</para>
  
  <para>You can opt to store the agent configuration locally if necessary.
  If you store the configuration locally, then avoid issues with the
  configuration by making sure you provide valid values for configuration
  properties ending in the following.</para>

  configuration, you select Access Control &gt; <replaceable>Realm
  Name</replaceable> &gt; Agents &gt; Web &gt; <replaceable>Agent
  Name</replaceable>. Web policy agent configuration is distinct from
  policy configuration. The only policy-like configuration that you apply to
  web policy agents is indicating which URLs in the web server can be
  ignored (<firstterm>not enforced URLs</firstterm>) and which client IP
  address are exempt from policy enforcement (<firstterm>not enforced
  IPs</firstterm>).</para>
  
  <para>For each aspect of web policy agent configuration, you can configure
  the policy agent through the OpenAM console during testing, and then
  export the resulting configuration in order to script configuration in
  your production environment.</para>
