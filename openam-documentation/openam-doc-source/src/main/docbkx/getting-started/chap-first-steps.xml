 <title>Protecting a Web Site With OpenAM</title>

 <para>You can get started with OpenAM using this chapter. Follow the steps in
 this chapter to learn how to protect a web site with OpenAM.</para>

 <important>
  <para>You need a Linux, Solaris, or Windows system that can run the web policy
  agent (see the <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="web-release-notes#platform-requirements-web-agents"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
  ><citetitle>Web Agents Platform Requirements</citetitle></link> if your system
  does not have an x86 or x64 based processor for example) with a minimum of 1
  GB of free RAM memory, a few hundred MB of free disk space, a web browser and
  Internet connection to download software.</para>

  <para>If you are running Mac OS X, set up a virtual machine running Linux to
  try these procedures because the web policy agent is not built for Apache HTTP
  Server on Mac OS X.</para>
 </important>

 <section xml:id="how-openam-helps-manage-access">
  <title>How OpenAM Helps Manage Access to Resources</title>

  <para>OpenAM provides a service called <firstterm>access management</firstterm>,
  which involves managing access to resources available over the network.
  Once you set up OpenAM to manage access, you have a centralized service to
  take control of who can access what resources, when, and under what
  conditions. In this chapter you manage access to a single web page. Yet, a
  resource can be just about anything accessible over the network from a
  web page, to an application, to a web service.</para>

  <para>OpenAM centralizes access control by handling both
  <firstterm>authentication</firstterm> and also
  <firstterm>authorization</firstterm>. Authentication is confirming an
  identity, for example confirming that a user has successfully logged in.
  Authorization is determining whether to grant access to someone who has
  authenticated.</para>

  <para>OpenAM centralizes authentication by using a variety of authentication
  modules. Authentication modules connect to identity repositories that store
  identities and provide authentication services. The identity repositories can
  be implemented as LDAP directories, relational databases, RADIUS, Windows
  authentication, one-time password services, other standards-based access
  management systems and much more. OpenAM lets you chain together the
  authentication services used. Authentication chains let you configure
  stronger authentication for more sensitive resources for example. They also
  let you set up modules that remember a device when the user logs in
  successfully. Or that evaluate the risk given the login circumstances and
  therefore can require more credentials when a user is logging in from an
  unusual location. This chapter uses OpenAM's built-in identity repository
  and authentication modules to make it easier to get started.</para>

  <para>OpenAM centralizes authorization by letting you use OpenAM to manage
  access policies separate from applications and resources. Instead of building
  access policy into a web application, you install a policy agent with the
  web application to request policy decisions from OpenAM. This way you can
  avoid issues that could arise when developers must embed policy decisions
  into their applications. With OpenAM, if policy changes or an issue is found
  after the application is deployed, you have only to change the policy
  definition in OpenAM, not deploy a new version of the application. OpenAM
  makes the authorization decisions, and policy agents enforce the decisions
  on OpenAM's behalf.</para>

  <para>The rest of this chapter has you demonstrate OpenAM access management
  by installing OpenAM, creating a policy, and installing a policy agent on
  a web server to enforce the policy for a web page.</para>

 <section xml:id="software-you-need">
  <title>Software Required To Try Out OpenAM</title>

  <para>In order to set up OpenAM to protect a web page, you install the
  following software, all of which is freely available. This chapter covers
  how to install the software, with the exception of the Java Development
  Kit.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>Java Development Kit</para>

    <para>OpenAM is a Java web application, and requires a Java Development Kit
    installed on the system where it runs.</para>

    <para>The web policy agent installer is also a Java program.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Apache HTTP Server</para>

    <para>Apache HTTP Server serves the web page to protect with OpenAM.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Apache Tomcat</para>

    <para>As a Java web web application OpenAM runs inside a web container,
    in this case Apache Tomcat.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>OpenAM core server with OpenAM Console</para>

    <para>This is the main web application for OpenAM. OpenAM sets up an OpenDJ
    directory server at configuration time to use in this case both to hold
    OpenAM's configuration and also to serve as an identity store and
    authentication service.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>OpenAM Apache Policy Agent</para>

    <para>You install a policy agent in Apache HTTP Server. The policy agent
    intercepts requests from users, and enforces access policy decisions made
    by OpenAM. The policy agent enforces policy both by redirecting users to
    OpenAM for authentication and by contacting OpenAM to get authorization
    decisions for resources such as the web page to protect.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Follow the steps in the next sections of this chapter to see how
  OpenAM can protect a web site without changing the web site itself.</para>

 <section xml:id="software-setup">
  <title>Setting Up the Software</title>

  <para>This section includes the following procedures that detail how to

  <para>The procedures in this section are written for use on a Linux system.
  If you are running Microsoft Windows, adapt the examples accordingly.</para>

  <procedure xml:id="prepare-etc-hosts">
   <title>To Prepare Your Hosts File</title>

   <para>OpenAM requires that you use fully qualified domain names when
   protecting web resources. This is because OpenAM uses <link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">HTTP cookies</link>
   to keep track of sessions for single sign on, and setting and reading
   cookies depends on the server name and domain.</para>

   <para>You can get started with OpenAM however without setting up separate
   systems for each fully qualified domain name. Instead, give your system
   <literal>openam.example.com</literal> and <literal>www.example.com</literal>
   aliases by editing your <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)"
   xlink:show="new">hosts file</link>.</para>

   <para>Alternatively, if you already have DNS set up, you can use that
   instead of using your hosts file.</para>

   <step>
    <para>Add the aliases to your hosts file using your preferred text
    editor.</para>

    <screen>$ sudo vi /etc/hosts
Password:

### Edit /etc/hosts ###

$ cat /etc/hosts | grep openam

  <procedure xml:id="install-apache-http">
   <title>To Install Apache HTTP Server</title>

   <para>Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server, and one that is well
   supported by OpenAM's web policy agents. Apache HTTP Server might already
   be installed on your system, but since you are installing software only
   to get started with OpenAM, install the web server separately rather than
   modify any existing installations.</para>

   <para>Full installation instructions are available <link xlink:show="new"

   <title>To Install OpenAM Web Policy Agent</title>

   <para>OpenAM policy agents enforce policies defined in OpenAM. The agent's
   job is to make sure that users have the right to access resources they
   request. And yet the agent does not make the policy decisions. Instead, the
   agent calls on OpenAM for policy decisions, using the information presented
   by the user (or the user's client application), such as the single sign on
   token in the HTTP cookie that OpenAM uses to keep track of user sessions.
   In essence the agent is a gatekeeper for OpenAM.</para>

   <para>The agent runs inside of Apache HTTP Server as a library that the
   server loads at startup time. When a request comes in, the agent redirects
   users to OpenAM for authentication and calls on OpenAM for policy decisions
   as necessary.</para>

   <step>
    <para>Download the OpenAM policy agent for your version of Apache HTTP
    Server either from the ForgeRock <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="http://forgerock.com/download-stack/"

    project nightly <link xlink:href="http://forgerock.org/openam.html"

   </step>

   <step>
    <para>Create a password file that the agent installer reads when first
    connecting to OpenAM to read its profile.</para>

    <para>The password file should be read-only by the user who installs
    the policy agent.</para>

    <screen>$ echo password > /tmp/pwd.txt
$ chmod 400 /tmp/pwd.txt</screen>

    <para>The password is stored encrypted after installation.</para>

   <step>
    <para>Make sure OpenAM is running.</para>

    <para>You can check for example by logging into OpenAM Console.</para>

  <title>Trying It Out</title>

  <orderedlist>
   <para>Now that you have completed <xref linkend="software-setup" />,
   you can try accessing the protected web page to see OpenAM at work.</para>

   <listitem>
    <para>Log out of OpenAM Console so that you can see the need to login when
    you try to access the Apache "It works!" page.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Browse to <literal>http://www.example.com:8000</literal> to attempt
    to access the Apache "It works!" page.</para>

    <para>At this point, the policy agent intercepts your request for the page.
    Your browser does not return a cookie indicating an OpenAM session, so the
    policy agent redirects you to OpenAM to authenticate.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>Log in as the built-in default OpenAM demonstration user
    <literal>demo</literal> with password <literal>changeit</literal>.</para>

    <mediaobject xml:id="figure-openam-login">
     <alt>OpenAM Login Page</alt>

      <imagedata fileref="images/openam-login.png" format="PNG"/>
     </imageobject>
     <textobject>
      <para>Log in as the default demonstration user as described in the
      instructions.</para>
     </textobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>On successful login, OpenAM sets a session cookie named
    <literal>iPlanetDirectoryPro</literal> in your browser for the domain
    <literal>.example.com</literal>. The cookie is then returned to servers
    in the <literal>example.com</literal> domain such as
    <literal>openam.example.com</literal> and
    <literal>www.example.com</literal>.</para>

    <para>If you examine this cookie in your browser, you notice that it has
    a value such as
    <literal>AQIC5wM2LY4SfcwciyfvJcQDUIB7kIWEH187Df_txqLdAVc.*AAJTSQACMDEAAlNLABMxMDYwNzY1MjQ0NTE0ODI2NTkx*</literal>.
    This is the SSO Token value. The value is in fact an encrypted reference to
    the session that is stored only by OpenAM. So only OpenAM can determine
    whether you are actually logged in, or instead that the session is no longer
    valid and you need to authenticate again.</para>

    <para>The OpenAM session is used for single sign on. When the browser
    presents the cookie to a server in the domain, the agent on the server can
    check with OpenAM using the SSO Token as a reference to the session. This
    allows OpenAM to make policy decisions based on who is authenticated, or
    to prompt for additional authentication as necessary.</para>

    <para>Your single sign on session can end in a few ways.  For example, when
    examining the cookie in your browser, you should notice that it expires when
    the browser session ends (when you shut down your browser). Alternatively,
    you can log out of OpenAM explicitly. Sessions can also expire. OpenAM
    sets two limits, one that causes your session to expire if it remains
    inactive for a configurable period of time (default: 30 minutes), and
    another that caps the session lifetime (default: 2 hours).</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>After successful login, notice that you are redirected to the Apache
    "It works!" page.</para>

    <mediaobject xml:id="figure-web-server-home-page-again">
     <alt>Apache HTTP Server home page stating It works!</alt>

     <textobject>
      <para>If everything works correctly you see the "It works!" page after
      successful login.</para>
     </textobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>In the background, OpenAM redirected your browser again to the page
    you tried to access originally, <literal>http://www.example.com:8000</literal>.
    This time the web policy agent intercepted the request and found the SSO
    Token, so it could request a policy decision from OpenAM regarding whether
    the user with the SSO Token has access to get
    <literal>http://www.example.com:8000/</literal>. OpenAM replied to the policy
    agent that it could allow access, and the policy agent allowed Apache HTTP
    Server to send back the web page.</para>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

   <para>Congratulations on protecting your first web site with OpenAM! Notice
   that you had only to install software and to configure things in OpenAM. You
   did not have to change your web site at all in order to add single sign on
   and to set up access policies.</para>
