 <title>Developing Client Applications</title>

 <para>Client applications access OpenAM services for authentication,
 authorization, and single sign on/single log out through the use of
 sessions. Client applications can also be allowed to manage authorization
 policies.</para>
 
 <para>Client application integration with OpenAM can be coupled loosely,
 as in the case of an application running in a web server with an OpenAM
 policy agent to handle interaction with OpenAM service, more directly,
 as in the case where the client interacts with OpenAM over protocol, or
 tightly, as in the case of an application using the OpenAM Java or C API
 to interact with OpenAM services.</para>
 
 <para>This part of the guide covers client interaction with OpenAM
 over supported protocols and using OpenAM APIs.</para>
