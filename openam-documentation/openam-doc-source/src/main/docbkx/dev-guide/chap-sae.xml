 <title>Using Secure Attribute Exchange</title>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Secure Attribute Exchange (SAE)</primary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>Most deployments can rely on OpenAM to handle authentication and provide
 identity assertions. Not only does OpenAM support a wide variety of
 authentication scenarios out of the box, but OpenAM also makes it possible to
 add custom authentication modules. Furthermore OpenIG lets you integrate
 legacy systems into your access management deployment.</para>

 <para>In a deployment where you need OpenAM to act as a SAML 2.0 gateway to a
 legacy application that serves as an identity provider, you can use OpenAM
 Secure Attribute Exchange (SAE). On the identity provider side, SAE lets
 OpenAM retrieve the information needed to create assertions from an external
 authentication service, bypassing OpenAM authentication and trusting the
 external service as the authoritative source of authentication. On the service
 provider side, SAE lets OpenAM securely provide attributes to an application
 that makes its own policy decision based on the attributes rather than rely on
 OpenAM for the policy decision.</para>

  <alt>External applications use SAE to participate in federation.</alt>

   <imagedata fileref="images/sae.png" format="PNG" />
  </imageobject>
  <textobject>
   <para>External applications use SAE to communicate with OpenAM providers.
   The providers in turn use SAML 2.0 to communicate with other
   providers.</para>
  </textobject>
 </mediaobject>

 <para>When you use SAE on the identity provider side, an external application
 acts as the authoritative source of authentication. After a user authenticates
 successfully, the application lets OpenAM know to create a session by sending
 a secure HTTP GET or POST to OpenAM that asserts the identity of the user.
 OpenAM processes the assertion to create a session for the user. If the user
 is already authenticated and comes back to access the application, the
 application sends a secure HTTP POST to OpenAM to assert both the user's
 identity and also any necessary attributes related to the user. OpenAM
 processes the assertion to create the session for the user and populate the
 attributes in the user's session. When the user logs out, the external
 authentication application can initiate single logout from the identity
 provider OpenAM server by sending the <literal>sun.cmd=logout</literal>
 attribute to OpenAM using SAE.</para>

 <para>On the service provider side OpenAM communicates using SAML 2.0 with
 OpenAM on the identity provider side. OpenAM can use SAE to transmit
 attributes to an application through a secure HTTP POST.</para>

 <para>SAE relies either on shared keys and symmetric encryption, or on public
 and private keys and asymmetric encryption to protect attributes communicated
 between OpenAM and external applications.</para>

 <para>OpenAM ships with sample JSPs that demonstrate secure attribute
 exchange. In order to try the sample, you must set up an OpenAM circle of
 trust to include an identity provider and a service provider, install the SDK
 sample web application on each provider and then configure the providers
 appropriately as described in this chapter to secure communications with the
 sample SAE applications on both the identity provider and service provider
 sides.</para>

 <section xml:id="sae-install-prerequisites">
  <title>Installing the Samples</title>

  <para>Set up an OpenAM server as an identity provider, and another as a
  service provider, connecting the two in a circle of trust called
  <literal>samplesaml2cot</literal>. Configure both the hosted providers and
  also the remote providers as described in <link
  xlink:href="admin-guide#set-up-federation"  xlink:show="new"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Setting Up SAML
  2.0 SSO</citetitle></link>. This chapter assumes you set up the hosted
  identity provider at <literal>http://idp.example.com:8080/openam</literal>
  and the hosted service provider at
  <literal>http://sp.example.com:8080/openam</literal>. Use Common Tasks &gt;
  Test Federation Connectivity in OpenAM console to make sure Federation is
  working before you add secure attribute exchange applications that rely
  on functioning SAML 2.0 communications between the providers.</para>

  <para>Set up the sample web application as described in <link
  xlink:href="dev-guide#install-jdk-samples" xlink:show="new"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Installing OpenAM
  Client SDK Samples</citetitle></link>, both on the identity provider side
  and also on the service provider side. The SAE samples are found under
  <filename>/saml2/sae</filename> where you installed the samples.
  <filename>saeIDPApp.jsp</filename> is the identity provider side external
  application. <filename>saeSPApp.jsp</filename> is the service provider side
  external application.</para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="sae-security-prerequisites">
  <title>Preparing to Secure SAE Communications</title>

  <para>In order for SAE to be secure, you must both set up a trust
  relationship between the application on the identity provider side and
  the OpenAM server acting as identity provider, and also set up a trust
  relationship between the application on the service provider side and
  the OpenAM server acting as the service provider. These trust
  relationships can be based on a shared secret and symmetric encryption,
  or on public and private key pairs and asymmetric encryption. The trust
  relationships on either side are independent. In other words you can for
  example use a shared secret on the identity provider side and
  certificates on the service provider side if you chose.</para>

  <para>When using symmetric encryption, you must define a shared secret
  string used both for the application and the provider. The sample uses
  <literal>secret12</literal> as the shared secret. To simplify
  configuration, the sample uses the same shared secret, and thus
  symmetric encryption, for both trust relationships.</para>

  <para>When using symmetric encryption, you must also use the encoded
  version of your shared secret. To get the encoded version of a shared
  secret string, use the <filename>encode.jsp</filename> page on the
  provider, as in
  <literal>http://idp.example.com:8080/openam/encode.jsp</literal> and
  <literal>http://sp.example.com:8080/openam/encode.jsp</literal>. An
  encoded version of <literal>secret12</literal> looks something like
  <literal>AQICEcFhDWmb6sVmMuCJuVh43306HVacDte9</literal>.</para>

  <para>When using asymmetric encryption, you must obtain a public-private
  key pair for the application, and store the keys in a key store on the
  application side. Also store the public key from OpenAM which is acting
  as the provider in the application's key store. Make note of the
  certificate aliases for your application's private key, and for OpenAM's
  public key. Also note the path to the key store for your application,
  the key store password, and the private key password.</para>
