 <title>About OpenAM Java EE Policy Agents</title>
 
 <para>OpenAM Java EE policy agents provide medium touch integration for
 web applications running in supported web application containers. Java EE
 policy agents require some configuration and code changes to deployed web
 applications. This chapter covers what Java EE policy agents do and how they
 work.</para>
 
 <para>A <firstterm>policy agent</firstterm> enforces policy for OpenAM. A
 <firstterm>J2EE policy agent</firstterm> installed in a web application
 container intercepts requests from users trying to access resources in
 protected web applications. The agent denies access until the user has
 authorization from OpenAM to access a particular resource.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="example-j2ee-agent-interaction">
  <title>How the User, Application, Policy Agent, &amp; OpenAM Interact</title>
  
  <para>Imagine that a user attempts to access a protected resource before
  having authenticated by pointing her browser to a page in a protected
  application. Assume that you have configured OpenAM to protect the web
  application. You have therefore installed the J2EE agent in the web container,
  and also configured the protected web application to use the agent filter,
  thus sending requests through the agent. Then the J2EE policy agent
  intercepting her filtered browser's request finds no session token in the
  request, and so redirects the user's browser to the OpenAM login page for
  authentication. After the user has successfully authenticated, OpenAM
  sets a session token in a browser cookie, and redirects her browser back to
  the page she tried to access initially.</para>
  
  <para>When the user's browser reiterates the request, the policy agent again
  checks that the request has a session token, finds a session token this
  time, and validates the session token with OpenAM. Given the valid session
  token, the policy agent gets a policy decision from OpenAM concerning whether
  the user can access the page. If OpenAM's Policy Service determines that
  the user is allowed to access the page, OpenAM responds to the policy agent
  that access should be granted. The J2EE policy agent then permits the page
  to be returned to the user's browser.</para>
  
  <para>You can also configure J2EE agent filters to work in tandem with
  the J2EE security policies defined alongside the policies for OpenAM. In this
  case the filter ensures the J2EE security policy grants access to the
  resource before the agent gets a decision from OpenAM.</para>

  <para>The following diagram shows how the pieces fit together when a Java
  EE client accesses a resource protected by a policy agent. This diagram is
  simplified to show only the essential principals rather than to describe
  every possible case.</para>

   <para>A Java EE policy agent is a web application installed in the web
   application container. Other applications have filters configured to
   call the policy agent when a client requests access to a protected resource
   in the application.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>The web client requests access to a protected resource.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>The web application filter settings put the request through the
    policy agent that protects the resource according to OpenAM policy. The
    policy agent acts to enforce policy, whereas the policy configuration and
    decisions are handled by OpenAM.</para>

   <listitem>
    <para>The policy agent communicates with OpenAM to get the policy
    decision to enforce.</para>

    allows access.</para>

  <title>How J2EE Policy Agents are Configured</title>
  
  <para>You install J2EE policy agents in the web application containers
  serving web applications that you want to protect. J2EE policy agents are
  themselves web applications running in the container whose applications you
  configure OpenAM to protect. By default, the J2EE policy agent has only
  enough configuration at installation time to connect to OpenAM in order to
  get the rest of its configuration from the OpenAM configuration store. With
  nearly all configuration stored centrally, you can manage policy agents
  centrally from the OpenAM console.<footnote><para>You can opt to store the
  agent configuration locally if necessary.</para></footnote></para>
  
  <para>For each web application that you protect, you also configure at least
  the deployment descriptor to filter requests through the policy agent.
  ForgeRock delivers the J2EE policy agents with a sample application under
  <filename>j2ee_agents/<replaceable>container</replaceable>_agent/sampleapp/</filename>
  demonstrating the configuration to use to protect your web application.</para>
  
  <para>You configure J2EE policy agents per OpenAM realm. Thus to access
  centralized configuration, you select Access Control &gt; <replaceable>Realm
  Name</replaceable> &gt; Agents &gt; J2EE &gt; <replaceable>Agent
  Name</replaceable>. J2EE policy agent configuration is distinct from
  policy configuration. The only policy-like configuration that you apply to
  J2EE policy agents is indicating which URLs in the web server can be
  ignored (<firstterm>not enforced URLs</firstterm>) and which client IP
  address are exempt from policy enforcement (<firstterm>not enforced
  IPs</firstterm>).</para>
  
  <para>For each aspect of J2EE policy agent configuration, you can configure
  the policy agent through the OpenAM console during testing, and then
  export the resulting configuration in order to script configuration in
  your production environment.</para>
