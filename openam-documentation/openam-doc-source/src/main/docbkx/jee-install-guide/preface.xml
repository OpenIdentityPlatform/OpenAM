  <title>Who Should Use this Guide</title>
  
  <para>This guide is written for anyone installing OpenAM policy agents to 
  interface with supported Java EE application containers.</para>
   
  <para>This guide covers procedures that you theoretically perform only
  once per version. This guide aims to provide you with at least some idea
  of what happens behind the scenes when you perform the steps.</para>
     
  <para>You do not need to be an OpenAM wizard to learn something from
  this guide, though a background in access management and maintaining
  web application software can help. You do need some background in
  managing services on your operating systems and in your application
  servers. You can nevertheless get started with this guide, and then
  learn more as you go along.</para>
