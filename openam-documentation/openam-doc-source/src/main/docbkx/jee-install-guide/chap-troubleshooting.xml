  <title>Solutions to Common Issues</title>

   <para>This section offers solutions to common problems when installing 
   OpenAM policy agents.</para>
  
  <qandaentry xml:id="cannot-install-over-https">
   <question>
    <para>I am trying to install a policy agent, connecting to OpenAM over
    HTTPS, and seeing the following error.</para>

    <screen>OpenAM server URL: https://openam.example.com:8443/openam

WARNING: Unable to connect to OpenAM server URL. Please specify the
correct OpenAM server URL by hitting the Back button (&lt;) or if the OpenAM
server URL is not started and you want to start it later, please proceed with
the installation.
If OpenAM server is SSL enabled and the root CA certificate for the OpenAM
server certificate has been not imported into installer JVMs key store (see
installer-logs/debug/Agent.log for detailed exception), import the root
CA certificate and restart the installer; or continue installation without
verifying OpenAM server URL.</screen>

    <para>What should I do?</para>
   </question>

   <answer>
    <para>The Java platform includes certificates from many Certificate
    Authorities (CAs). If however you run your own CA, or you use self-signed
    certificates for HTTPS on the container where you run OpenAM, then the
    <command>agentadmin</command> command cannot trust the certificate
    presented during connection to OpenAM, and so cannot complete installation
    correctly.</para>

    <para>After setting up the container where you run OpenAM to use HTTPS,
    get the certificate to trust in a certificate file. The certificate you
    want is the that of the CA who signed the container certificate, or the
    certificate itself if the container certificate is self-signed.</para>

    <para>Copy the certificate file to the system where you plan to install the
    policy agent. Import the certificate into a trust store that you will use
    during policy agent installation. If you import the certificate into the
    default trust store for the Java platform, then the
    <command>agentadmin</command> command can recognize it without additional
    configuration.</para>

    <para>Export and import of self-signed certificates is demonstrated in the
    <citetitle>Administration Guide</citetitle> chapter on <link
    xlink:show="new" xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-certs-keystores"

    Certificates</citetitle></link>.</para>

  <qandaentry xml:id="cannot-install-with-ibm-java">
   <question>
    <para>I am trying to install the WebSphere policy agent on Linux.
    The system has IBM Java. When I run <command>agentadmin --install</command>,
    the script fails to encrypt the password from the password file, ending
    with this message:</para>

    <literallayout class="monospaced"
    >ERROR: An unknown error has occurred (null). Please try again.</literallayout>

    <para>What should I do?</para>
   </question>

   <answer>
    <para>You must edit <command>agentadmin</command> to use IBMJCE, and then
    try again.</para>

  <qandaentry xml:id="websphere-SRVE0190E-file-not-found">
   <question>
    <para>After installing a Java EE policy agent on WebSphere AS 7 or 8,
    accessing a URL for a folder in a protected application such as
    <literal>http://openam.example.com:9080/test/</literal> results in
    <literal>Error 404: SRVE0190E: File not found: {0}</literal>, and
    redirection fails. What should I do to work around this problem?</para>
