OpenAM Diagnostic Tool

It is assumed that OpenAM Server is available.

6. Invoking the diagnostic tool 

1. About Diagnostic Tool
------------------------
OpenAM Diagnostic Tool provides a means to validate the sanity of configured
instance and environment. The tool can be used to verify the configuration 
settings and identify any possible issues. The issues that can occur after the 
product is installed/deployed/configured can be either static or dynamic. Static
issues pertain to misconfigurations, while the dynamic issues occur during 
run-time. The tool does not address the dynamic issues. 

2. Supported versions of Java Runtime
-------------------------------------
Java SE 7 or higher.

Note: Embedded quotes in JAVA_HOME environment variable are not supported.

3. Architecture
---------------
This tool can be extended since the implementation is based on a plug-in model. 
Product/field teams or partners can build custom diagnostic tool services 
(plug-ins) for new services that can be seamlessly integrated with the existing 
services.

Each feature that is part of the tool and provides certain functionality in a 
domain, is viewed as a service.  For example, a tool that provides OpenAM 
Server configuration related feature is viewed as "Server configuration service"
or in the server domain. A given service can provide one or more related 
operations in a particular functional area. For example, "Server configuration 
service" may provide features to view server configuration parameters, validate 
session-failover configuration etc.  

4. Contents of this package 
---------------------------
The directory in which the tool is unzipped is referred as ZIP_ROOT.

The directory layout would look something as :

	<ZIP_ROOT>
	|
	|----README (file containing the information about the Tool)
	|
	|----license.txt
	|	
	|----ssodtool.sh
	|	
	|----ssodtool.bat
	|	
	|----config (Any configuration related files required by the Tool)
	|     
	|----lib (jar files that are required by the tool to operate)
	| 
	|----services (All the services implemented should be under this 
        |     |        directory, including service descriptor files 
        |     |        i.e. service.xml, jar files, resource files etc)        
	|     |
	|     |----resources (Properties file, images etc required by the 
	|     |               services)
	|     |----lib (Jar files required by the services)
        |     |
	|     |----sample 
	|    	 |                    
	|     	 |----service.xml (Defines the sample service)
        |        |
	|     	 |----sample_service.xml (Defines the sample service)
	|    	 |     (This is a sample service used to illustrate the 
        |        |      structure of service descriptor file. Any new service 
        |        |      can use this file as a reference for integration into 
        |        |      the tool. Once a new service is implemented, create a 
        |        |      separate directory if the need be and place all the 
        |        |      related files under this new directory. The tool when 
        |        |      started will pick this new service and shall display
        |        |      in the GUI or CLI.

5. Adding new services  
-----------------------
New services can be seamlessly added to the Diagnostic Tool. Refer to the sample
java code provided under the sample service. The new service can provide 
additional functionality as a service or as a feature to an existing service 
domain. Adding a new service domain or functionality needs to add a new 
directory with the domain specific name under the services directory. 
Additionally, the service should provide a service descriptor file providing the 
service specific details.  

In order to add a new feature to an existing service domain, the service 
descriptor file of that service needs to be updated with the corresponding 
entry. 

6. Invoking the diagnostic tool 
--------------------------------
Diagnostic Tool can be invoked in two modes i.e. CLI or GUI. The default 
behavior is GUI mode and can be overridden as shown in step 7b and 7c. 

a. Invoking the diagnostic tool in GUI mode.
   %cd <ZIP_ROOT>  

   For Unix platforms:
   >ssodtool.sh

   For Windows platforms:
   >ssodtool.bat

b. Invoking the diagnostic tool in CLI mode using the "--console" option.
   %cd <ZIP_ROOT> 

   For Unix platforms:
   >ssodtool.sh --console

   For Windows platforms:
   >ssodtool.bat --console

c. Invoking the diagnostic tool in CLI mode using the configuration 
   property. 
 
   The default behavior can be changed to CLI mode by editing the 
   configuration file (DTConfig.properties) under 
   <ZIP_ROOT>/config directory.

   %cd <ZIP_ROOT>/config  

   Set the property as follows to override the default GUI mode:
   odt.application.runmode=CLI

   Invoke the tool in CLI mode for Unix platforms:
   >ssodtool.sh 

   Invoke the tool in CLI mode for Windows platforms:
   >ssodtool.bat
