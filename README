%% 1. Maven build requirements and structure

Maven provides a simpler structure, making the development and build process
easier to use and faster to run. New features are easier to isolate for
reviews and migration. It is also a recommended method of implementing best
business practices.

%% 1.1  Build requirements

The OpenAM workspace is based on a standard Maven build and uses Maven as the
build framework.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 7. In order to allow
this, you must ensure that JDK 7 is present in your system path and the
JAVA_HOME environment variable is setup correctly pointing to its location. The
target JDK is set to 7, and the recommended compiler is 7 or higher.

Please see this URL for the latest instructions on how to compile OpenAM:
https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/openam/Build+OpenAM+from+Source.

%% 1.2  Maven structure

The Maven OpenAM subfolders includes three areas:

     - community                                : extensions of the OpenAM product created within the community
     - openam                                   : the core and supplementary components of OpenAM supported by ForgeRock
     - opensso                                  : policy agents and legacy OpenAM components

    * The ssoSessionTools has been removed from the build. It will be returned to the build in a later release.

%% 2. Library dependencies

The standard version of Maven automatically resolves the third-party libraries.Third-party
libraries are hosted on the ForgeRock depot repository at
http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/maven-central.

%% 3. Building the workspace

The first Maven build will likely take longer than all subsequent builds to
accommodate the lengthy dependency artifact chain. Following a successful build,
a .war file will reside in the openam-server/target directory.
