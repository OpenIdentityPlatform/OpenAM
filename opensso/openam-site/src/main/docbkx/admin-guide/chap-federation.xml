 <title>Managing SAML 2.0 SSO</title>

 <para>This chapter addresses how to set up and manage SAML 2.0 SSO for
 single sign on and single log out across resources belonging to
 organizations participating in a circle of trust.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="about-federation">
  <title>About SAML 2.0 SSO &amp; Federation</title>
  <indexterm><primary>Federation</primary></indexterm>
  <para>SAML 2.0 SSO is part of federated access management. Federation lets
  access management cross organizational boundaries. Federation helps
  organizations share identities and services without giving away their
  identity information, or the services they provide.</para>
  
  <para>To bridge heterogenous systems, federation requires interoperability,
  and thus depends on standards for orchestrating interaction and exchanging
  information between providers. OpenAM federation relies on standards such as
  <link xlink:href="http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications">Security Assertion
  Markup Language (SAML) 2.0</link>. SAML 2.0 describes the messages, how they
  are relayed, how they are exchanged, and common use cases.</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>To achieve SAML 2.0 SSO, OpenAM separates <firstterm>identity
   providers</firstterm> from <firstterm>service providers</firstterm>,
   lets you include them them in a <firstterm>circle of trust</firstterm>, and
   has you configure how the providers in the circle of trust interact.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>An identity provider stores and serves identity profiles, and
    handles authentication.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A service provider offers services that access protected
    resources, and handles authorization.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>A circle of trust groups at least one identity provider and at least
    one service provider who agree to share authentication information, with
    assertions about authenticated users that let service providers make
    authorization decisions.</para>
    <para>Providers in a circle of trust share <firstterm>metadata</firstterm>,
    configuration information that federation partners require to access each
    others' services.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>SAML 2.0 SSO maps attributes from accounts at the identity provider to
    attributes on accounts at the service provider. The identity provider makes
    assertions to the service provider, for example to attest that a user has
    authenticated with the identity provider. The service provider then
    consumes assertions from the identity provider to make authorization
    decisions, for example to let an authenticated user complete a purchase
    that gets charged to the user's account at the identity provider.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>In federation deployments where not all providers support SAML 2.0,
  OpenAM can act as a multi-protocol hub, translating for providers who rely
  on other and older standards such as SAML 1.x, Liberty Alliance Project
  frameworks, and WS-Federation (for integration with Active Directory
  Federation Services, for example).</para>

 <section xml:id="set-up-federation">
  <title>Setting Up SAML 2.0 SSO</title>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>Before you set up SAML 2.0 SSO in OpenAM, you must:</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>Know which providers participate in the circle of trust.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Know how your OpenAM installations act as identity providers, or
    service providers.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Agree with other providers on a synchronized clock or time service
    to share for provider systems.</para>
    <para>Processing messages you exchange requires synchronized time
    keeping.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>For identity information exchanged with other participants in a
    circle of trust, define how to map user attributes you share. Your user
    profile attribute names map to user profile attribute names at other
    providers.</para>
    <para>For example, if you exchange user identifiers with your partners, and
    you call it <literal>uid</literal> whereas another partner calls it
    <literal>userid</literal>, then you map your <literal>uid</literal> to
    your partner's <literal>userid</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Import the keys used to sign assertions into the JKS key store in
    your OpenAM configuration directory. You can use the Java
    <command>keytool</command> command.</para>
    <para>The OpenAM configuration key store is located at the top level of
    the configuration directory, such as
    <filename>$HOME/openam/keystore.jks</filename>. The password,
    stored in <filename>$HOME/openam/.keypass</filename>, is
    <literal>changeit</literal> by default. Also by default the only key
    available is for a self-signed certificate (alias: test) installed with
    OpenAM.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>During set up, you must share metadata for providers that you host
  with other providers in the circle of trust. You must also configure
  remote providers, connecting to other providers by importing their
  metadata.</para>
  
   <para>In OpenAM terms, a hosted provider is one served by the current
   OpenAM server, whereas a remote provider is one hosted elsewhere.</para>
