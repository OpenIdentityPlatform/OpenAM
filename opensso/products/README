    %% 4. Building the demo

%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenSSO workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. The build scripts
in this workspace use features not present in releases of Ant prior to 1.6.
Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have Ant version 1.6.5 or above
installed and available in your system path.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 6.0. In order to allow
this, you must ensure that JDK 6.0 is present in your system path and the
JAVA_HOME environment variable is setup correctly pointing to its location. The
target JDK is set to 1.5.

%% 2. Library dependencies

The OpenSSO sources depend upon a few third-party libraries that are not
included as a part of the workspace and must be obtained directly from 
the library vendor or distributor. Some of these libraries are available in 
source distribution form and must be built locally before they can be used. 
The libraries needed for compiling OpenSSO sources are:

   - Java EE 5 SDK: j2ee.jar, mail.jar
   - SUN shared library jars: jaxb-api.jar, jaxb-impl.jar, 
     jaxb-libs.jar, jaxb-xjc.jar, jaxrpc-impl.jar, jaxrpc-spi.jar, 
     jaxrpc-api.jar, activation.jar, saaj-api.jar, saaj-impl.jar, 
     relaxngDatatype.jar, xmlsec.jar, xalan.jar, xsdlib.jar, 
     FastInfoset.jar, jsr173_api.jar, webservices-api.jar,
     webservices-rt.jar, webservices-tools.jar, webservices-extra.jar,
     webservices-extra-api.jar, OpenDS.jar, je.jar,
     mfwk_instrum_tk-2.0.jar, xercesImpl.jar, jss4.jar
   - TestNG version 5.9 : testng-5.9-jdk15.jar
   - Secure Attribute Exchange API: fmsae.dll and fmsae64.dll
   - Open Message Queue: mq4_4-v2-AIX.zip,mq4_4-v2-Linux_X86.zip, 
                         mq4_4-v2-SunOS_X86.zip,mq4_4-v2-SunOS.zip,
                         mq4_4-v2-WINNT.zip,imq.jar and jms.jar
   - Apache Commons Codec: commons-codec-1.3.jar
   - OpenDS 2.3.x distribution ZIP file

Once these libraries are available, they should be placed under the 
"opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace. Any library placed 
in this directory is automatically included in the classpath during the 
compilation phase of the build process.

The following subsections briefly describe how these libraries may be 
obtained. These instructions are provided for your convenience only and
are not intended to replace or invalidate the procedures/guidelines set
by the library vendor or distributor for obtaining those libraries. Before
you follow these instructions, you must agree to abide by any terms and
conditions set forth by the library vendor or distributor. In case any of
these instructions are in contradiction to such terms or conditions, you 
must disregard those instructions and instead follow the ones provided by
the library vendor or distributor in accordance with their terms and 
conditions.

%% 2.1 Obtaining j2ee.jar and mail.jar

The j2ee.jar and mail.jar library can be obtained from Java EE 5 SDK.

      one of the three distribution types available under Java EE 5 SDK
      Update 1.
2.1.3 Extract or extract and install the downloaded file as necessary to
      have the SDK available on your system.

Once the J2EE SDK is installed, you can get the javaee.jar and mail.jar from 
the lib directory of this SDK. You must rename javaee.jar to j2ee.jar when 
copying it to the "opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace.

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
   
     - build      : compiles the sources
     - doc        : creates javadocs
     - clean      : deletes the generated files
     - demo       : builds the demo application
     - demo-clean : deletes generated demo files
     - war        : builds the WAR
     - war-clean  : deletes generated WAR
     - usage      : displays this usage message

%% 3.1 build target

The build target involves the following processing:

3.1.1 Creation of build output directories such as 
        <workspace-root>/built
        <workspace-root>/built/classes
        <workspace-root>/built/resources
        <workspace-root>/built/docs
        <workspace-root>/built/docs/api

3.1.2 Compiles all the classes present in the source directory to the
      built/classes directory. The compilation debug flag is set to
      "-g:none" but can be changed by defining the following two properties
      in your user level property file $HOME/.opensso:
      
      - build.debug: allowed values are on and off. Example: build.debug=on

      - build.debuglevel: one or more of lines, vars, source as a comma
          separated list. Example: build.debuglevel=lines,source

3.1.3 Transfers the resource and xml files from the resources and xml 
      directories to the built area under the built/resources directory.
      The two exceptions are:

      - the file sms.dtd is copied over to the classes directory under
        the package com/sun/identity/sm as per its defined location for
        reference by other xml files.

      - the properties files Services.properties, DSConfig.properties,
        ums.properties, sso.properties, SMS.properties and 
        authentication_util.properties are combined into a single
        properties file called amSDK.properties.

      The xml files are tag-swapped to change the XML_ENCODING tag with
      the value ISO-8859-1.

%% 3.2 doc target

The doc target involves the following processing:

3.2.1 Creation of build output directories such as 
        <workspace-root>/built
        <workspace-root>/built/classes
        <workspace-root>/built/resources
        <workspace-root>/built/docs
        <workspace-root>/built/docs/api

3.2.2 Executes the javadoc tool with output directory set to built/docs/api
      and includes the following packages:
        com/iplanet/sso/**
        com/iplanet/dpro/**
        com/sun/identity/session/**

      The "**" indicate all sub-packages underneath the current package.

%% 3.3 clean target

The clean target removes all the build output directories.

%% 3.4 demo target

The demo target first invokes the build target and then delegates the
further processing to the build.xml file present under the demo directory.
This target cannot be executed directly unless certain configuration tasks
are performed as described in the file demo/README. Please refer to this file
for further details on the configuration tasks needed prior to building the
demo.

%% 3.5 demo-clean target

Issues a clean to the build.xml file present under the demo directory. This
target is useful in case you are interested in rebuilding the demo without
rebuilding the entire OpenSSO distribution. By issuing the demo-clean target
the build output area for the OpenSSO distribution is not changed and only
the demo related build output area is cleaned.

%% 3.6 war target

The war target first invokes the build target and then delegates the
further processing to the build.xml file present under the war directory.
A deployable WAR file will be created under federation/openfm/built/war/dist
directory after this target is successful executed.

%% 3.7 war-clean target

Issues a clean to the build.xml file present under the war directory. This
target is useful in case you are interested in rebuilding the war without
rebuilding the entire OpenSSO distribution. By issuing the war-clean target
the build output area for the OpenSSO distribution is not changed and only
the war related build output area is cleaned.

%% 3.8 usage target

Displays a list of available targets along with a brief description of
each available target for quick reference.

%% 4. Building the demo

Before building the demo, please follow any instructions described in the
file demo/README. This file also describes the necessary background 
information regarding the demo and the details of how it works.
