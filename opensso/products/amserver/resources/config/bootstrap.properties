# This property sets the base directory where the product 
# will be configured. When this property is set, one shall
# not be able to enter an other base directory in the
# configurator.jsp.
# Currently, there is only one tag that we are supporting
# and that is @REAL_PATH@. So you have it as
#
# configuration.dir=/opensso/AMConfig@REAL_PATH@
#
# @REAL_PATH@ shall be substituted with ServletContext.getRealPath()
# when the web application is configuring.
# 
# If this property is not set, one shall be able to enter the
# base directory in the configurator.jsp.
#
# This property should be used for application servers like
# JBoss where the ServletContext.getRealPath() method does
# not always return the same value after the server is restarted.
#
# This property should also be used when the system user that
# is running the web/application server process does not have
# a home directory. i.e. System.getProperty("user.home") returns
# null.
#
# configuration.dir=
