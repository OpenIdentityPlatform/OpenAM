%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenSSO J2EE Agent workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. 
The build scripts in this workspace use features not present in 
releases of Ant prior to 1.6.5.  Thus, in order to build this workspace 
you must have Ant version 1.6.5 or above installed and available in 
your system path.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 5.0 or newer with 
the source and target levels set to "1.5". In order to allow this, you 
must ensure that JDK 5.0 (or newer) is present in your system path and the
JAVA_HOME environment variable is setup correctly pointing to its location.


%% 2. Library dependencies

The OpenSSO J2EE Agent sources depend upon a few third-party libraries 
that are not included as a part of the workspace and must be obtained 
directly from the library vendor or distributor. Some of these libraries 
are available in source distribution form and must be built locally 
before they can be used. 

The libraries needed for compiling OpenSSO J2EE Agent sources are:

   - OpenSSO Agents Common Installer libraries
   - OpenSSO ClientSDK library
   - J2EE Container specific libraries
   - Commons IO library
   - JAVA EE API library

Once these libraries are available, they should be placed under the 
extlib directory of the specific J2EE Container in workspace. For example,
the libraries for Sun Application Server 8.1/8.2/9.0/9.1/10 agent should be placed
under appserver/v10/extlib directory.  Any library placed in this directory 
is automatically included in the classpath during the compilation phase of
the build process.

The following subsections briefly describe how these libraries may be 
obtained. These instructions are provided for your convenience only and
are not intended to replace or invalidate the procedures/guidelines set
by the library vendor or distributor for obtaining those libraries. Before
you follow these instructions, you must agree to abide by any terms and
conditions set forth by the library vendor or distributor. In case any of
these instructions are in contradiction to such terms or conditions, you 
must disregard those instructions and instead follow the ones provided by
the library vendor or distributor in accordance with their terms and 
conditions.

%% 2.1 Obtaining OpenSSO Agents Common Installer libraries

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers several build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
   
     - all           : build all the J2EE agents
     - clean         : deletes the generated files
     - usage         : displays this usage message
     - appserver_v10 : build the Sun Appserver 8.1/8.2/9.0/9.1/10 agent
     - weblogic_v10  : build the WebLogic 10.0 agent
     - websphere_v61 : build the Websphere 6.1 agent
     - jboss_v42     : build the JBoss 4.0.x and 4.2.x and 5.x agent
     - tomcat_v6     : build the Tomcat 6.0 agent
     - jetty_v61     : build the Jetty Server 6.1.x agent.
     - jsr196_jsr115 : build the JSR196 and JSR115 agent

directory, and it can be used later to install the agent.

%% 3.6 websphere_v61 target

The websphere_v61 target first invokes the build target and then 
delegates the further processing to the build.xml files present under 
the websphere and websphere/v61 directories.  Upon successful execution,
a zip file websphere_v61_agent_3.zip will be created under built/dist 
directory, and it can be used later to install the agent.

%% 3.7 jboss_v42 target

The jboss_v42 target first invokes the build target and then 
delegates the further processing to the build.xml files present under 
the jboss and jboss/v42 directories.  Upon successful execution,
a zip file jboss_v42_agent_3.zip will be created under built/dist 
directory, and it can be used later to install the agent.

%% 3.8 tomcat_v6 target

The tomcat_v6 target first invokes the build target and then 
delegates the further processing to the build.xml files present under 
the tomcat and tomcat/v6 directories.  Upon successful execution,
a zip file tomcat_v6_agent_3.zip will be created under built/dist 
directory, and it can be used later to install the agent.

%% 3.9 jetty_v61 target

The jetty_v61 target first invokes the build target and then 
delegates the further processing to the build.xml files present under
the jetty and jetty/v61 directories.  Upon successful execution,
a zip file jetty_v61_agent_3.zip will be created under built/dist
directory, and it can be used later to install the agent.

%% 3.10 jsr196_jsr115 target

The jsr196_jsr115 target first invokes the build target and then
delegates the further processing to the build.xml files present under
the jsr196 and jsr196/jsr115 directories. Upon successful execution,
a zip file jsr196_jsr115_agent_3.zip will be created under built/dist
directory, and it can be used later to install the agent.
