%% 1. General Description and Assumption

General Description :
   The samples provided here are JAX-WS based Web Service and a Web Services
   Client.

   The sample demonstrates a simple stock quote service where given
   a stock ticker symbol it obtains stock data. The secure communication
   between stock quote web services client is achieved using
   OpenAM web services security agents.

   The following diagram depicts a simple deployment scenario where the
   profiles of WSC and WSP are all hosted on a single OpenAM instance.

                            |__________|

Assumption :
   1) You have installed and configured OpenAM server.
   2) OpenAM server runs in the same domain (example, ".sun.com") as the domain
      of the server in which WSC application is running. This is required for
      SSO between OpenAM server and WSC application, when end user
      authentication happens in showcasing Web Service Security between WSC and
      WSP.

%% 2. Environment requirements

   2.1 Ant (version "1.7" or higher)
       The OpenAM Web Services Security Agents workspace uses Apache Ant as the
       build tool. The build scripts in this workspace use features not present
       in releases of Ant prior to 1.7.  Thus, in order to build this workspace
       you must have Ant version 1.7 or above installed and available in your
       system path.
       Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the Ant root directory, and add
       ${ANT_HOME}/bin to your PATH environment variable.

   2.2 JDK 1.6 (version "1.6.0_12" or higher)
       The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK "1.6.0_12" or 
       higher with the source and target levels set to "1.6.0_12" or higher.
       In order to allow this, you must ensure that JDK "1.6.0_12" or higher is
       present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is
       setup correctly pointing to its location.
       All the deployment containers should be also running with JDK "1.6.0_12" 
       or higher so that the runtime JDK version would be same as the compile
       time JDK version.

   2.3 JAX-WS Library
       Download the latest stable version of JAXWS Reference Implementation from
       http://jax-ws.dev.java.net. 
       Execute the downloaded jar with the command : java -jar <filename>.jar
       After the files have been extracted, note the location of the lib folder
       found within the extracted folder and use this value for the
       "jaxws.lib" property within the
       <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/jaxws.properties
       file for the Web Service Client and Web Service Provider.

       For example, the value of "jaxws.lib" property would be:
       jaxws.lib=<jaxws_install_location>/lib

   2.4 [Only for deployment on Tomcat container]

       To make Tomcat 6.x JAX-WS aware, edit the <TOMCAT_HOME>/conf/
       catalina.properties file and set the shared.loader property as shown:

       shared.loader=<jaxws_install_location>/lib/*.jar

       If you are running multiple instances of Tomcat, then edit
       <CATALINA_BASE>/conf/catalina.properties for that particular instance.

   2.5 [Only for deployment on Sun Web Server container]

       To make Sun Web Server 7.x JAX-WS aware, edit
       <webserver_install_dir>/admin-server/config/server.xml file and
       <webserver_install_dir>/<https-servername>/config/server.xml file
       to add JAX-WS lib to the existing JVM server class path as shown:

       <jvm>
       ....
       <server-class-path><jaxws_install_location>/lib:....</server-class-path>
       ....
       </jvm>

   2.6 [Only for deployment on JBoss container]

       2.5.1 To make JBoss 5.x JAX-WS aware, download JBossWS, the JBoss Web
             Services stack (Metro/Apache CXF version 3.1.1.GA).
             The version of JBossWS needed depends on the version of JBoss
             Application Server that you are running.
             Note : Please do not download/use JBossWS native package as it runs
             into some conflict issues with native Web Services stack when used
             with these OpenAM WSS agents.
       2.5.2 To install the stack downloaded in the previous step, unzip the
             downloaded file and modify the file ant.properties.example by
             providing the JBOSS_HOME value based on the version of JBoss you
             are using. All the other values can be left to default. Save the
             file as ant.properties in the same location.
       2.5.3 Run the ant target deploy-jbossxxx where xxx is the version of
             JBoss.
             For example, if you are using JBoss 5.0.0.GA, the command would be:
             ant deploy-jboss500
             Refer to the JBoss website for detailed installation instructions.
   
%% 3. [Optional] If Building and Deploying the Un-Secured Samples,
      then follow this section, else go to section 4.

   3.1 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockService
       If you plan to deploy on Tomcat or Sun Web Server, then run
       "ant tomcat-war" Else run "ant war".
       This will generate StockService.war under "dist" directory, deploy this
       war on any JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or
       higher.

   3.2 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples
       The protocol, host and port number of the container where the
       StockService is deployed, will need to be changed for "wsdlLocation" in,
       etc/Tomcat/StockClient/unsecure/GetQuote.java for Tomcat or
       Sun Web Server deployment
       OR
       etc/config/StockClient/GetQuote.java for rest of the containers.

   3.3 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockClient
       If your deployment container is Tomcat or Sun Web Server, then run
       "ant tomcat-war" Else run "ant war".
       This will generate StockClient.war under "dist" directory, deploy this
       war on any JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or
       higher.

   The WARs generated above can be deployed on GlassFish v2.x, WebLogic 10.x,
   JBoss 5.x, Tomcat 6.x, Sun Web Server 7.x & WebSphere 7.x, all running with
   JDK "1.6.0_12" or higher.
   For deployment changes required on WebSphere 7.x, go to section 8.

%% 4. Building and Deploying the Secured Samples

   You can use ONE of the following options (A or B) for deployment on any
   JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or higher.

   A) Using configurator script / utility

     4.1 To generate secured StockService.war

       4.1.1 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockService
           If you plan to deploy on Tomcat or Sun Web Server, then run
           "ant tomcat-build" Else run "ant build".

       4.1.2 Run "<wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/ant config" to generate
           secured StockService.war by entering appropriate input as follows :
           
        [input] Enter OpenAM Server URL :
        <server_protocol>://<server_host.server_domain>:<server_port>/<server_deploy_uri>

        [input] Enter type of application (WSC/ WSP) : (WSC, WSP)
        WSP

        [input] Enter location of un-secured WAR file OR
                location of un-secured application's staging area :
        <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockService/web

        [input] Enter the name of secured war file to be generated (e.g. mySecuredApp.war) :
        StockService.war

        [input] Enter the package structure of application class file (e.g. com/sun/stockquote) :
        com/sun/stockquote

           This will generate secured StockService.war under
           <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/secured_war directory, deploy this
           war on any JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or
           higher.

     4.2 To generate secured StockClient.war

       4.2.1 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples
           The protocol, host and port number of the container where the
           StockService is deployed, will need to be changed for "wsdlLocation" in,
           etc/Tomcat/StockClient/secure/GetQuote.java for Tomcat or Sun Web Server
           deployment
           OR
           etc/config/StockClient/GetQuote.java for rest of the containers.

       4.2.2 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockClient
           If your deployment container is Tomcat or Sun Web Server, then run
           "ant tomcat-secure-build" Else run "ant build".

       4.2.3 Run "<wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/ant config" to generate
           secured StockClient.war by entering appropriate input as follows :

        [input] Enter OpenAM Server URL :
        <server_protocol>://<server_host.server_domain>:<server_port>/<server_deploy_uri>

        [input] Enter type of application (WSC/ WSP) : (WSC, WSP)
        WSC

        [input] Enter location of un-secured WAR file OR
                location of un-secured application's staging area :
        <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockClient/web

        [input] Enter the name of secured war file to be generated (e.g. mySecuredApp.war) :
        StockClient.war

        [input] Enter the package structure of application class file (e.g. com/sun/stockquote) :
        com/sun/stockquote

           This will generate secured StockClient.war under
           <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/secured_war directory, deploy this
           war on any JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or
           higher.

   B) Using manual configuration steps

       4.1 Follow <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/README file
           (if you have not done already)
           a) To add the keystore related files to the local file system,
           by copying <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/resources/keystore.jks,
           <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/resources/.keypass and
           <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/resources/.storepass files to some
           directory that can be later referred in
           <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/config/AMConfig.properties file and
           b) To modify the <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/config/AMConfig.properties
           file, in order to update properties that are at the top of the file, under
           heading "Following properties need to be updated for OpenAM WSS Agents".

       4.2 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockService
           If you plan to deploy on Tomcat or Sun Web Server, then run
           "ant tomcat-secure-war" Else run "ant secure-war".
           This will generate StockService.war under "dist" directory, deploy this
           war on any JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or
           higher.

       4.3 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples
           The protocol, host and port number of the container where the
           StockService is deployed, will need to be changed for "wsdlLocation" in,
           etc/Tomcat/StockClient/secure/GetQuote.java for Tomcat or Sun Web Server
           deployment
           OR
           etc/config/StockClient/GetQuote.java for rest of the containers.

       4.4 cd <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockClient
           If your deployment container is Tomcat or Sun Web Server, then run
           "ant tomcat-secure-war" Else run "ant secure-war".
           This will generate StockClient.war under "dist" directory, deploy this
           war on any JAX-WS compliant container running with JDK "1.6.0_12" or
           higher.

   The WARs generated above can be deployed on GlassFish v2.x, WebLogic 10.x,
   JBoss 5.x, Tomcat 6.x, Sun Web Server 7.x & WebSphere 7.x, all running with
   JDK "1.6.0_12" or higher.
   For deployment changes required on WebSphere 7.x, go to section 8.
   
%% 5. OpenAM Server Configuration

   Login into the OpenAM Console with user amadmin and <amadmin password>,
   invoking following URL

   openamserver_protocol://openamserver_host:openamserver_port/
                                                        openamserver_deploy_uri

   Note: If you have logged in as any other user, click Logout on the console
         page and Login again and make sure that you access the OpenAM Console.

   5.1 Configuring cookie encode property (If you have not done already)

       5.1.1 Go to Configuration -> Servers and Sites -> Default Server Settings ->
       5.1.2 Click on "Advanced" tab and set property value for
             "com.iplanet.am.cookie.c66Encode" property to be "true".
       5.1.3 Save changes.

   5.2 Enabling STS Security for WSC profile in OpenAM

       By default, this sample will use the default WSC and WSP profiles that
       OpenAM ships with (named as "wsc" and "wsp" respectively).

       5.2.1 Go to Access Control -> Default realm -> Agents ->
       5.2.2 Select Web Service Client -> click on "wsc" profile to edit ->
       5.2.3 Select required Security Mechanism as "STSSecurity"
       5.2.4 Select STS Configuration as "SecurityTokenService"
       5.2.5 Save changes.
    
   Logout of OpenAM and Restart the container.

%% 6. Testing the Samples

   6.1 From your web browser, access <protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockClient

   6.2 With unsecure Samples, you should be directed to the page with a simple
       form to enter the Stock Symbol of your choice. Click Get Quote button.
       The StockService should return the stock results. On this page,
       click on the links named Request and Response in the image illustrating
       the communication. You should see the SOAP request and response without
       any security token in the SOAP request/response headers.

   6.3 With the secure Samples, you will be redirected to OpenAM's Authentication
       service for end user login. Enter any existing OpenAM user with the
       password. Upon successful end user authentication, you will be redirected 
       back to <protocol>://<host>:<port>/StockClient/ page. Click Get Quote for
       a symbol of your choice and by clicking on the Request/Response links on
       the stock quote results page, you can see the Web Service communication
       is secured with WS-Security token in the SOAP request/response headers.

   Notes :
       1) With the secure Samples, you will be always redirected to OpenAM's
          Authentication service for end user login first. If you want this end
          user authentication redirection to be done based on WSC's profile /
          configuration by reading "User Authentication Required" flag setting, 
          then the property "com.sun.identity.wss.wsc.providername" needs to be
          set in the StockClient side AMConfig.properties file and its value
          should be the WSC provider name. Also If you have multiple WSC talking
          to same service (WSP), then you can identify each WSC's profile
          uniquely by specifying this com.sun.identity.wss.wsc.providername
          property value in the WSC side AMConfig.properties file.
          For WSC profile name, com.sun.identity.wss.wsc.providername property
          takes precedence over the WSDL service name. If both are absent, then
          default name as "wsc" (this is created out of box) is used.

          For this sample, you can use and set this property as shown below :
          com.sun.identity.wss.wsc.providername=wsc

          Make sure to re-war the StockClient web application (war file) and
          redeploy on the required JAX-WS compliant container running with
          JDK "1.6.0_12" or higher.

       2) Even after successfully retrieving stock quote results page, if the
          request / response links on the StockClient web page do not show any
          data or have exception showing data, then create "openam" directory
          under your "user.home" directory on the machine where StockClient and
          StockService web applications are running.

%% 7. Explanation of changes for Tomcat or Sun Web Server

   7.1 StockService WAR

       7.1.1 Because Tomcat or Sun Web Server is a Web Container (not a Java EE
             container) and does not support JSR 109 service endpoint, the
             JAX-WS service WAR deployed in Tomcat or Sun Web Server needs a
             special deployment descriptor which defines a set of "endpoints".
             This descriptor is the XML file - <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/
             samples/etc/Tomcat/StockService/sun-jaxws.xml. This file describes
             the JAX-WS service endpoint which represents a web particular
             published web service (StockService), and is copied to
             <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockService/web/WEB-INF/
             folder.
       7.1.2 The Web Service servlet in the web.xml file needs to be configured
             to the com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet class from
             JAX-WS Reference implementation that comes with JAX-WS libraries
             after download and install of JAX-WS RI. Hence
             <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockService/web/
             WEB-INF/web.xml file is replaced with
             <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/etc/Tomcat/
             StockService/web.xml file.

   7.2 StockClient WAR

       7.2.1 The @WebServiceRef and @HandlerChain annotations are not supported
             by Tomcat or Sun Web Server and hence, the web service reference
             and jax-ws handler chain needs to be invoked programmatically by
             making the required changes to the implementation class.
             Due to this, <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/StockClient
             /src/com/sun/stockquote/GetQuote.java is replaced with
             <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/etc/Tomcat/StockClient/
             unsecure/GetQuote.java for Unsecure applicaton WAR OR it is
             replaced with <wssagents_unzip_location>/wssagent/samples/etc/Tomcat/
             StockClient/secure/GetQuote.java for Secure applicaton WAR.

             The ..secure/GetQuote.java has following additional line over
             ..unsecure/GetQuote.java.

             handlerChain.add(new com.sun.identity.wssagents.jaxws.client.ClientHandler());

             This line is required by Client application in order to invoke the
             WSS Client Handler for securing outgoing Web Service requests.

%% 8. Deployment changes for WebSphere Application Server (WAS)

   8.1 Upgrade to JDK "1.6.0_12" or higher.

       WAS 7.0 is bundling with java version "1.6.0", hence you need to
       upgrade WAS 7.0 to 7.0.0.5 and upgrade its JDK to IBM JDK 1.6.0 SR5,
       equivalent to SUN JDK 1.6.0.13.

   8.2 Create shared libraries.

       8.2.1 Create a directory for shared libraries e.g. shared_libs.
