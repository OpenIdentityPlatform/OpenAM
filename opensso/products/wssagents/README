    %% 1. Build requirements
    %% 2. Library dependencies
    %% 3. Building the workspace


%% 1. Build requirements

The Web Services Security Agents workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. 
The build scripts in this workspace use features not present in releases 
of Ant prior to 1.6.  Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have 
Ant version 1.6.5 or above installed and available in your system path.
Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the Ant root directory, and add 
${ANT_HOME}/bin to your PATH environment variable.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 5.0 with the source
and target levels set to "1.4". In order to allow this, you must ensure that
JDK 5.0 is present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable
is setup correctly pointing to its location.

%% 2. Library dependencies

%% 2.1 Follow section 2 of the README under the "opensso/products" directory to
       resolve external library dependencies, and copy corresponding jars to 
       the "opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace.
        
%% 2.2 To resolve external library dependencies per container, copy corresponding 
       container specific jars to extlib directory of your workspace 
       as -
       opensso/products/wssagents/extlib
       
       For example, for WebLogic Server, you need to add weblogic.jar under
       opensso/products/wssagents/extlib
       You can get the weblogic.jar from a weblogic server installation.

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
 
     - build           : compiles the sources
     - unittest        : generates unit test zip file
     - samples         : generates sample WARs
     - jars            : creates JAR files
     - clean           : deletes the generated files
     - usage           : displays this usage message
