ForgeRock OpenAM Enterprise Web Services Security (WSS) Agents are the SOAP protocol
type of JAX-WS handlers that intercept inbound and outbound Web Service
requests/responses (SOAP messages) in order to secure them.
You can easily plug these handlers into the JAX-WS 2.1 runtime environment.

To secure your web service application (WSC / WSP), either unsecured war file OR
unsecured staging area, with OpenAM WSS Agents,
using installer/configurator utility, run

wssagent/ant config

for WSC and WSP applications each (separately).
You can customize "security credentials to authenticate to OpenAM server and
read the configuration data" and "Unique agent profile name to be used for WSC"
in wssagent/config/WSSAgentInputData.properties file, if you do not want to use
default values set.
You can also specify the other input data in
wssagent/config/WSSAgentInputData.properties file so that this
installer/configurator utility can run silently, without prompting for
user input.
Note : Make sure you have Ant (version "1.7" or higher) in CLASS PATH
