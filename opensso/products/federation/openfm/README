%% Contents:
    %% 1. Build requirements
    %% 2. Library dependencies
    %% 3. Building the workspace


%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenFederation Library workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. 
The build scripts in this workspace use features not present in releases 
of Ant prior to 1.6.  Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have 
Ant version 1.6.5 or above installed and available in your system path.
Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the Ant root directory, and add 
${ANT_HOME}/bin to your PATH environment variable.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 5.0 with the source
and target levels set to "1.4". In order to allow this, you must ensure that
JDK 5.0 is present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable
is setup correctly pointing to its location.

%% 2. Library dependencies

%% 2.1 Follow section 2 of the README under the "opensso/products" directory to
       resolve external library dependencies, and copy corresponding jars to 
       the "opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace. 
%% 2.2 Follow section 2 of the README under the 
       "opensso/products/federation/library" directory to resolve 
       library dependencies for Open Federation Library.
%% 2.3 Open Federation depends on "opensso/products/amserver" branch of 
       openSSO. You could
       - check out the "opensso/products/amserver" branch source code 
       or
       - download opensso_server_samples.war, console.jar, amserver.jar, 
         opensso-test.jar, amclientsdk.jar, amAdminTools.zip, 
         openssosamples.zip, amclientsdk.jar, opensso-sharedlib.jar from
         https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/use/index.html and copy them to 
         the "opensso/products/federation/extlib" directory of your workspace.

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
 
     - build           : compiles the sources
     - unittest        : generates unit test zip file
     - samples         : generates sample WARs
     - war             : creates WAR for deployment
     - clientsdk       : creates client SDK jar file
     - doc             : creates javadocs
     - clean           : deletes the generated files
     - usage           : displays this usage message
