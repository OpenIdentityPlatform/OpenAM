# AGENT USERNAME AND PASSWORD PROPERTIES
#   These are the credentials used by the Agent to identify and
#   authenticate itself before requesting any services. 
#   - organization.name:  Specifies the organization or realm name to be used 
#       for authenticating the Agent during runtime. 
#       The default value "/" identifies the root organization or realm.
#   - username: Agent profile name
#   - password: Agent profile's password 
#   - key: Encryption key to encrypt agent profile password
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No

# Hot-Swap Enabled: No

#
# AGENT DEBUG LOG LEVEL
#   Set the logging level for the specified logging categories.
#   The format of the values is
#
#	<ModuleName>[:<Level>][,<ModuleName>[:<Level>]]*
#
#   The currently used module names are: AuthService, NamingService,
#   PolicyService, SessionService, PolicyEngine, ServiceEngine,
#   Notification, PolicyAgent, RemoteLog and all.
#
#   The all module can be used to set the logging level for all currently
#   none logging modules.  This will also establish the default level for
#   all subsequently created modules.
#
#   The meaning of the 'Level' value is described below:
#
#	0	Disable logging from specified module*
#	1	Log error messages
#	2	Log warning and error messages
#	3	Log info, warning, and error messages
#	4	Log debug, info, warning, and error messages
#	5	Like level 4, but with even more debugging messages
#       128	log url access to log file on AM server. 
#       256	log url access to log file on local machine. 
#
#   If level is omitted, then the logging module will be created with
#   the default logging level, which is the logging level associated with
#   the 'all' module.
#
#   For level of 128 and 256, you must also specify audit.access.type property.
#
#   Even if the level is set to zero, some messages may be produced for
#   a module if they are logged with the special level value of 'always'.
#
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No

#
# SSL comunication related properties
#   The following properties are for to establish secure communication
#   between agent and access manager.
#
#   - sslcert.dir: Name of the directory containing the certificate databases for SSL.
#   - certdb.prefix: Set this property if the certificate databases in the directory
#         specified by the previous property have a prefix.
#   - certdb.password: Certificates database password.
#   - auth.certificate.alias: Certificate alias.
#   - trust.server.certs: Should agent trust all server certificates when OpenSSO server
#         is running SSL? Valid values are {true, false}

# Hot-Swap Enabled: No

# Connection timeout related properties
#
#   - receive.timeout: Time in milliseconds the agent will wait to receive the
#       response from OpenSSO server. After the timeout, the connection
#       will be drop. A value of 0 means that the agent will wait until 
#       receiving the response.
#       WARNING: Invalid value for this property can result in 
#       the resources becoming inaccessible.
#   - connect.timeout: In milliseconds indicates how long the socket connection 
#       needs to be kept open.  The default value is 0 which implies no timeout.
#   - tcp.nodelay.enable: Indicate if the socket option TCP_NODELAY should be enabled.
#       Possible values are true or false. Default is false.
#
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No

# Proxy server settings
#
# Configure these properties only if a proxy server is in between Agent 
# and OpenSSO server machine and is configured in forward proxy mode. 
# In this case all communication between Agent and OpenSSO server 
# should go thru this proxy server
# 
#   - proxy.host     - Proxy server host name
#   - proxy.port     - Proxy server port number
#   - proxy.user     - User name if Basic Auth is enabled in proxy server

# AGENT PROFILE NAME
#   The profile name used by the Agent to fetch the agent configuration data.
#   The value of this property is the same as that of 
#   com.sun.identity.agents.config.username in most cases. 
#
#   However if multiple agent instances need to use the same credentials
#   to authenticate (referred as Agent Authenticator), following changes 
#   need to be done
#   1. com.sun.identity.agents.config.profilename should have the value of the
#      profile to be read
#   2. com.sun.identity.agents.config.username should have the value of the
#      Agent Authenticator
#   3. com.sun.identity.agents.config.password should have the password of
#      Agent Authenticator (this can be generated by executing the below 
#      command. "passwordFile" should have the password of Agent Authenticator.
#      ./agentadmin --encrypt <agentInstance> <passwordFile>
# Hot-Swap Enabled: No
