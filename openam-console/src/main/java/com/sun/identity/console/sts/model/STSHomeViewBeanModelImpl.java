/**
 * This class is a bit of a 'tricky move': the STSHomeViewBean needs a single model, but needs to represent state from
 * two services - the rest and soap sts. So the STSInstanceModel interface provides functionality to satisfy the STSHomeViewBean,
 * and the rest and soap create and add view beans. Ultimately, both the RestSTSInstanceModel and the SoapSTSInstanceModel will get the bulk
 * of their functionality from the STSInstanceModelBase, which extends the AMServiceProfileModelImpl class, thereby providing the
 * functionality to harvest property-sheet state, and turn it into the {@code Map<String, Set<String>>} format which can
 * be POSTed or PUT to sts-publish/rest or sts-publish/soap to create/update rest/soap instances. However, the page in
 * the STS pane which displays the table of both rest and soap sts instances, which is handled by the STSHomeViewBean,
 * also needs a AMModel implementation, one which can satisfy referencing two services. This class satisfies this need,
 * but delegates the work to either the restSTSInstanceModel or the soapSTSInstanceModel.
 *
 * Note also that the Rest- and Soap- specific edit and add ViewBean classes do not return an instance of this class
 * from getModelInternal, but rather an instance of the RestSTSInstanceModel or the SoapSTSInstanceModel, as these extend the
 * AMServiceProfileModelImpl class, which is necessary to represent a service instance.
