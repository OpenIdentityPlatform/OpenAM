 <para>This chapter covers prerequisites for installing OpenAM software,
 including how to prepare your application server to run OpenAM, how to prepare
 directory services to store configuration data, and how to prepare an identity
 repository to handle OpenAM identities.</para>

   <primary>fully-qualified domain name</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>OpenAM requires that you provide the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
  when you configure it. Before you set up OpenAM, be sure that your system
  has an FQDN such as <literal>openam.example.com</literal>. For evaluation
  purposes, you can give your system an alias using the
  <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file on UNIX systems or
  <filename>%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</filename> on Windows. For
  deployment, make sure the FQDN is properly assigned for example using
  DNS.</para>

  <para>Do not use the <literal>localhost</literal> domain for OpenAM, not even
  for testing purposes. OpenAM relies on browser cookies, which are returned
  based on domain name. Furthermore, use a domain name that contains at least 2
  <literal>.</literal> (dot) characters, such
  <literal>openam.example.com</literal>.</para>

  <important><para>
   Do not configure a top-level domain as your cookie domain as browsers will
   reject them.
   </para>
   <para>
   Top-level domains are browser-specific.
    Some browsers, like Firefox, also consider special domains like Amazon's web
    service (for example, ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com) to be a top-level domain.

   <primary>maximum file descriptors</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   If you use the embedded OpenDJ directory, make sure OpenDJ has enough
   file descriptors. OpenDJ needs to be able to open many files,
   especially when handling many client connections.

   Linux systems in particular often set a limit of 1024 per user,
   which is too low for OpenDJ.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenDJ should have access to use at least 64K (65536) file descriptors.
   The embedded OpenDJ directory runs inside the OpenAM process space.

   When running OpenAM as user <literal>openam</literal> on a Linux system
   that uses <filename>/etc/security/limits.conf</filename> to set user limits,
   you can set soft and hard limits by adding these lines to the file.
  </para>

  <programlisting language="none">
openam soft nofile 65536
openam hard nofile 131072
  </programlisting>

  <screen>
$ <userinput>ulimit -n</userinput>
<computeroutput>65536</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>
   The example above assumes the system has enough file descriptors overall.

   You can verify the new soft limit the next time you log in as user
   <literal>openam</literal> with the <command>ulimit -n</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can check the Linux system overall maximum as follows.

   <secondary>preparing</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>OpenAM stores user identity data in one or more identity repositories.
   In many deployments OpenAM connects to existing LDAP directory services
   for user identity data. OpenAM is designed therefore to share data in an
   identity repository with other applications.</para>

  <para>OpenAM ships with an embedded OpenDJ directory server that you can
   install as part of the OpenAM configuration process. In deployments where you
   will only ever have a few users to manage and do not need to share identity
   data with other applications, you can use the embedded store as your identity
   repository and avoid the additional overhead of maintaining a separate
   directory service. If OpenAM will share identity data with other applications,
   or if you expect to have lots of users, then connect OpenAM to an external
   identity repository. See the <link xlink:show="new"
                                      xlink:href="release-notes#chap-before-you-install"

    Notes</citetitle></link> for a list of supported external identity
   repositories.</para>

  <para>When OpenAM connects to an external identity repository, the
   administrator must give OpenAM the following access rights.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenAM requires specific directory schema definitions for the object
     classes and attribute types that describe its data. The directory
     administrator can find these definitions in the <filename>ldif</filename>
     directory found inside the full .zip delivery.</para>

    <para>If the directory administrator chooses instead to have OpenAM update
     the directory schema at configuration time, then the directory administrator
     must grant OpenAM access.</para>

    <para>To grant this access right with OpenDJ for example, first add a global
     ACI permitting the OpenAM user to modify schema definitions as in the
     following example where the OpenAM entry has DN
     <literal>uid=openam,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com</literal>.</para>

    <programlisting language="ldif">
global-aci: (target = "ldap:///cn=schema")(targetattr = "attributeTypes ||
   objectClasses")(version 3.0;acl "Modify schema"; allow (write)(userdn = "
   ldap:///uid=openam,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com");)</programlisting>

    <para>Also give the OpenAM user privileges to modify the schema and write
     to subentries such as the schema entry. Set the following attributes on
     the OpenAM user entry.</para>

    <programlisting language="ldif">
ds-privilege-name: subentry-write
ds-privilege-name: update-schema</programlisting>

   <listitem>
    <para>When OpenAM connects to an external identity repository, it requires
     access to read and potentially to update data.</para>

    <para>To grant the access rights with OpenDJ for example, add following ACIs
     to the configuration base DN entry. Adjust them as necessary if the OpenAM
     user DN differs from
     <literal>uid=openam,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com</literal>.</para>

  <para>
   OpenAM stores its configuration, session, and token data in an LDAP
   directory service. OpenAM ships with an embedded OpenDJ directory server
   that you can install as part of the OpenAM configuration process.
   By default, OpenAM installs the embedded directory server alongside its
   configuration settings under the $HOME directory of the user running OpenAM
   and runs the embedded directory server in the same JVM memory space as OpenAM.
  </para>

  <para>
   With the embedded OpenDJ directory and the default configuration
   settings, OpenAM connects as directory super user, bypassing access control
   evaluation because OpenAM manages the directory as its private store. Be aware
   that failover and replication cannot be controlled when using the embedded store.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before deploying OpenAM in production, measure the impact of
   using the embedded directory not only for relatively static configuration
   data, but also for volatile session and token data. Your tests should subject
   OpenAM to the same load patterns you expect in production. If it looks like
   a better choice to use an external directory service, then use one of the
   supported external configuration stores listed in the
   <link xlink:show="new"
         xlink:href="release-notes#chap-before-you-install"
         xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Release
    Notes</citetitle></link>, such as OpenDJ.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenAM supports the Core Token Service (CTS),
   a centralized token repository for OpenAM session tokens, OpenID Connect ID tokens, and
   SAML 2.0 tokens, which can be stored in a locally embedded or external
   directory store together or separately from OpenAM configuration data. For more information,
   see the chapter on <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#chap-cts"

  <tip>
   <para>
    If you are the directory administrator and do not yet know directory services
    very well, take some time to read the documentation for your directory server,
    especially the sections covering directory schema and procedures on how

      When OpenAM connects as <literal>uid=openam,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com</literal>
      to an external directory server to store its data, it requires both read
      and write access privileges. You add these privileges by means of access control
      instructions (ACIs) to the base distinguished name (DN) entry
      (<literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>). If your OpenAM user has a different
      DN other than <literal>uid=openam,ou=admins,dc=example,dc=com</literal>,
      adjust the ACIs where appropriate.

     <para>
      You must also give privileges to the OpenAM user to modify the schema and write
      to subentries such as the schema entry. To grant these privileges, you include
      the following attributes on the OpenAM user entry:
      <literal>ds-privilege-name: subentry-write</literal> and
      <literal>ds-privilege-name: update-schema</literal>.

      Note that if you are having trouble with this LDIF file,
      consider removing the line feeds for the ACI attributes
      and let it wrap to the next line. If you are still having trouble using

   OpenAM supports CORS, but CORS is not configured out of the box.
  </para>

  <orderedlist>

    Instead, you must edit the deployment descriptor file

   OpenAM examples often use Apache Tomcat as the deployment container.

   and listens on the default ports,
   with no Java Security Manager enabled.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenAM core services require a minimum JVM heap size of 1 GB,
   and a permanent generation size of 256 MB.
   If you are including the embedded OpenDJ directory,
   OpenAM requires at least a 2 GB heap,
   as 50% of that space is allocated to OpenDJ.
   See <xref linkend="prepare-java" /> for details.
  </para>

  <para>
   ForgeRock recommends that you edit the Tomcat &lt;Connector> configuration
   to set <literal>URIEncoding="UTF-8"</literal>.
   UTF-8 URI encoding ensures that URL-encoded characters
   in the paths of URIs are correctly decoded by the container.
   This is particularly useful when applications use the OpenAM REST APIs,
   and some identifiers such as user names can contain special characters.
  </para>

                reconfiguring OpenAM. To avoid this issue, take the following steps:</para>

     When deploying OpenAM on WebLogic 11g (version 10.3.x),
     use the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) implementation
     from the Java Runtime Environment, rather than the WebLogic implementation.

     The WebLogic implementation can cause OpenAM to throw exceptions with the
     message <literal>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException:
     This class does not support SAAJ 1.1</literal>,
     and to fail to authenticate users in some cases.

     No change is necessary when deploying OpenAM on WebLogic 12c.
    </para>

    <para>
     To use the Sun/Oracle Java SAAJ implementation,
     edit the WebLogic start up script for the domain where OpenAM runs, such as
     <filename>/path/to/weblogic/user_projects/domains/wlsdomain/startWebLogic.sh</filename>.

     Change the following line:

     <programlisting language="shell">${DOMAIN_HOME}/bin/startWebLogic.sh $*</programlisting>

     When using WebLogic 12.1.1 with Java 6,

     then make the following change to the start up script,
     <filename>startWebLogic.sh</filename>,
     to avoid exceptions and incorrect results.
