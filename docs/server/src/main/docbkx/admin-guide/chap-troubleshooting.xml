   <qandaentry xml:id="cannot-write-to-config-directory">
    <question>
     <para>OpenAM configuration could not write to the configuration directory.
     Where must I change permissions, and what permissions are required?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>If the user running the web container has a $HOME directory, then
     the configuration directory is stored there, and you probably do not have
     this problem. If you do not know the user running the web container, use
     the <command>ps</command> command to check. In the following example, the
     user is <literal>mark</literal>, the web container
     <literal>tomcat</literal>.</para>

     <screen>
$ <userinput>ps -ef | grep tomcat</userinput>
<computeroutput>mark      1739     1  0 14:47...</computeroutput>
     </screen>

     <para>For a container installed from native packages with a dedicated
     user, $HOME may not be where you think it is. Look at the user's entry in
     <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> to locate the home directory.
     The user running the web container where you install OpenAM must
     be able to read from and write in this directory.</para>
     <para>If you cannot change the permissions to the user's home directory,
     you can, as a workaround, unpack <filename><?eval ${coreWarFile}?></filename>, 
     set the <literal>configuration.dir</literal> property in the
     <filename>WEB-INF/classes/bootstrap.properties</filename> to a directory
     with appropriate permissions, and repack <filename>openam.war</filename>
     with the adjusted file before deploying that.</para>

     <screen>
$ <userinput>cd ~/Downloads/openam/${coreWarFile}</userinput>
$ <userinput>mkdir unpacked ; cd unpacked</userinput>
$ <userinput>jar xf ../${coreWarFile}</userinput>
$ <userinput>vi WEB-INF/classes/bootstrap.properties</userinput>
$ <userinput>grep ^config WEB-INF/classes/bootstrap.properties</userinput>
<computeroutput>configuration.dir=/my/readwrite/config/dir</computeroutput>

   <qandaentry xml:id="deploy-failed-lack-of-memory">
    <question>
     <para>Deployment failed due to lack of memory. What do I do?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>OpenAM requires at least a maximum heap size of 1024 MB, with a 256
     MB maximum permanent generation heap size. For the Sun JVM, ensure the
     container starts with <literal>-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m</literal>
     for these settings.</para>
     <para>If you do not know the settings used when the web container was
     started, use the <command>ps</command> command to check. In the following
     example, the web container is <literal>tomcat</literal>.</para>

     <screen>
$ <userinput>ps -ef | grep tomcat | grep Xm</userinput>
<computeroutput>... -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m ...</computeroutput>
     </screen>

     <para>Make sure you have at least 2 GB of RAM on the system where you
     run OpenAM to avoid running out of memory.</para>

     <para>If you make it through deployment and seem to be running out of
     memory later, you can confirm memory errors in OpenAM by searching the
     <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/openam/debug/*</filename>
     files for <literal>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</literal>.</para>

    <question>
     <para>Deployment failed due to invalid hostname configuration. What do
     I do?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>OpenAM requires that you use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
     that the host can resolve.</para>

     <screen>
$ <userinput>ping openam-ter.example.com</userinput>
<computeroutput>PING openam-ter (192.168.56.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

     in <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> (<filename

    <question>
     <para>I configured OpenAM, and now am seeing the configuration screen
     again. Who deleted my configuration?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>OpenAM uses a file in <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename> to
     bootstrap and find its configuration. The file is named after the path
     to OpenAM and contains the path to the configuration. The following
     example shows what the file looks like for OpenAM deployed in Apache
     Tomcat under <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam</filename>, and
     running as user <literal>amuser</literal> with <literal>$HOME</literal>
     <filename>/home/amuser</filename>.</para>

     <para>The <command>ssoadm</command> command is very, very slow on my
     virtual machine (VMWare, VirtualBox, etc.). How can I speed it up?</para>
    </question>

    <answer>
     <para>Virtual machine random devices do not always produce enough random
     data. The <command>ssoadm</command> command can hang while reading random
     data from the virtual machine's random device, with the result that you
     can wait a minute or more for a single command to finish.</para>

     <para>To work around this limitation on virtual machines, make sure you
     install something that generates enough random data, such as a <link

   <qandaentry xml:id="websphere-smtp-ssl">
    <question>
     <para>
      I have OpenAM installed in WebSphere application server with IBM Java.
      I am doing REST-based user registration or forgotten password reset,
      or setting up the HOTP authentication module,
      sending mail to an SMTP server over SSL.
     </para>

     <para>
      How come OpenAM cannot send mail over SSL?
     </para>
    </question>

    <answer>
     <para>
      If you see in the OpenAM Authentication debug log
      that the SSL handshake is failing when connecting to the mail server,
      then it is likely that the SSL certificate presented by the mail server
      is not trusted.
     </para>

     <para>
      This is a WebSphere/IBM Java issue, rather than an OpenAM issue.
     </para>

     <para>
      To work around the problem, follow these steps
      to make sure that WebSphere trusts the mail server SSL certificate.

        For example, if you are sending mail through Google mail as my.user,
        then set Host to <literal>smtp.gmail.com</literal>,

     <para>
      After WebSphere restarts, it should trust the mail server SSL certificate.

     <para>
      What can I do to prevent all these messages from being logged?
     </para>
    </question>

    <answer>

    <question>
     <para>I have session failover configured for an OpenAM site. I see many

    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>When you have session failover configured for a site, OpenAM servers
     run health checks against other servers in the same site. By default, the
     health checks are run every second (1000 milliseconds) with a timeout of 1
     second (1000 milliseconds).</para>

     <para>If there is network latency between servers in a site, for example
     if you are running your servers in virtual machines, the default settings
