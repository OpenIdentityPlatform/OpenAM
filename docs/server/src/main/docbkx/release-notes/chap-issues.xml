  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Different OpenAM Version within a Site</emphasis>.
     Do not run different versions of OpenAM together in the same OpenAM
     site.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting Referral Policy</emphasis>.
     OpenAM allows you to delete a referral policy
     even if policies depending on the referral still exist in the target realm.
     Deleting a referral policy that other policies depend on
     can cause problems during policy evaluation.
     You must therefore make sure that no policies
     depend on any referrals that you delete.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Avoid Use of Special Characters in Policy or
     Application creation</emphasis>.
     Do not use special characters within policy, application or referral names
     (for example, "my+referral") using the Policy Editor or REST endpoints as
     OpenAM returns a 400 Bad Request error.
     The special characters are: double quotes ("), plus sign (+), command (,),
     less than (&lt;), equals (=), greater than (&gt;), backslash (\), and null (\u0000).

     The OpenAM REST endpoint names that should not be used includes: "users",
     "groups", "realms", "policies" and "applications".

     When deploying OpenAM components on Microsoft Windows in an IPv6 environment,
     you must use the Java 7 Development Kit on Windows (due to

           xlink:href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6230761">JDK-6230761</link>,

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Enforcing Session Quotas with Session Failover</emphasis>.
     By default OpenAM does not enforce session quotas when running in Site
     mode without session failover. To work around this behavior, set the server
     configuration property
     <literal>openam.session.useLocalSessionsInMultiServerMode=true</literal>.
     You can set this property in OpenAM console under Configuration &gt; Servers
     and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; Server Name &gt; Advanced.</para>

   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">OpenAM with Embedded Directory Server in IPv6 Networks</emphasis>.
     On hosts with pure IPv6 networks, OpenAM configuration has been seen to fail
     while starting the embedded OpenDJ directory server

     As of this writing, JBoss 6.3/AS 7.4.0 does not support Java 8.

     The <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal> instance passed to

     The <literal>HttpServletResponse</literal> instance passed to

     OpenAM can only import XACML 3.0 files that were either created by an
