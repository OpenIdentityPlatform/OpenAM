g101=OpenID Connect Claims extension Script Timeout
g101.help=The maximum execution time any individual script should take on the server (in seconds).
g101.help.txt=Scripts will be forcibly stopped after this amount of execution time.
g102=Core thread pool size
g102.help=The core size of the thread pool from which scripts will operate.
g103=Maximum thread pool size
g103.help=The maximum size of the thread pool from which scripts will operate.
g103.help.txt=New threads will be created up to this size once the task queue reaches capacity. Has no effect if the \
  queue is unbounded.
g104=Thread pool queue size
g104.help=Size of queue to use for buffering script execution request when core pool is at capacity.
g104.help.txt=Use -1 for an unbounded queue (this disables the maximum pool size setting). For short, CPU-bound \
  scripts, consider a small pool size and larger queue length. For I/O-bound scripts (e.g., REST calls) consider \
  a larger maximum pool size and a smaller queue. Not hot-swappable: restart server for changes to take effect.
g105=Thread idle timeout (seconds)
g105.help=Length of time (in seconds) to wait before terminating threads.
g105.help.txt=Length of time (in seconds) to wait before terminating threads that were started when the queue reached \
  capacity. Only applies to threads beyond the core pool size (up to the maximum size).
g106=Java class whitelist
g106.help=List of patterns of allowed Java classes that may be loaded/accessed by scripts.

g107=Java class blacklist
g107.help=List of patterns of Java classes that must not be accessed by a script.
g107.help.txt=This blacklist is applied after the whitelist to apply additional restrictions. For instance you may \
  whitelist java.lang.* and then blacklist java.lang.System and java.lang.Runtime. It is recommended to always prefer \
  specific whitelists where possible.
g108=Use system SecurityManager
g108.help=Indicates whether the system SecurityManager should also be consulted when checking access to Java classes.
g108.help.txt=If enabled, then the checkPackageAccess method will be called for each Java class accessed. If no \
  SecurityManager is configured, then this has no effect.

  If the locale and pipe is omitted, the description is displayed to all users having undefined locales. \
  e.g. "read|Permission to view email messages in your account". \
  <i>NB</i> If the description is also omitted, nothing is displayed to all users, e.g. specifying "read|" would allow \
  the scope "read" to be used by the client, but would not display it to the user when it was requested.
