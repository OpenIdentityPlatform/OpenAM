/**
 * Responsible for serialising and deserialising objects to and from JSON.
 *
 * Note: This serialisation mechanism uses Jackson's ability to detect fields in an object to serialise.
 * It does not use getters and setters (JavaBean based) which is the default. See the configuration that
 * is defined in the constructor for more details.
 *
 * Note: Important caveat, JSON does not handle Maps with keys that are not strings (Enums, Objects etc). This
 * is covered here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11246748/deserializing-non-string-map-keys-with-jackson?lq=1
 * the recommendation is to switch the map to use strings as keys and convert accordingly. If necessary it is
 * possible to implement custom KeySerializer/KeyDeserializer implementations to ensure the map keys are correctly
 * handled during serialisation and deserialisation. The default KeySerializer implementation calls toString on the
 * key object, which may be suitable in certain cases.
 *
 * Note: Another Important caveat, It appears that Jackson basically handles poorly any Object that is not a
 * String, Integer, Map or a List. Based on this I cannot recommend this class as a general purpose Object to JSON
 * serialisation class, unless the caller makes extra effort to ensure that their objects are being
 * serialised following the above guidelines.
